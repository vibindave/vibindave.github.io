Let's take indian relationship concepts into consideration... 
Most of them are getting overridden. But let's see
Well... We really suck at this domain according to me! Well there are exceptions like me! ≡ƒÿé(only I know) 
First.. Indian relationship doesn't come with trial offers. There are no two level propose system in India. If you ask someone to be your gf/bf, it comes with an expectation of marriage. So
No trial period... Well it sucks right ≡ƒÿé
There's one more thing. 'Sex' only after wearing the most stable protection...na na.. In India.. It's not condom... It's wedding ring. And one more thing... We don't talk about sex in India... But most of them do immense research visiting different countries through vpn!. 
When I said about previous issue to someone, I got a reply. "If he's ready to wait for you... It's a proof that he's really in love with you" Indeed our relationship comes with patience testing and it's good right since in other countries they test endurance first. 
Impressing a girl it's not enough in India for a love marriage. Her dad, mom and also that brother who wish to kick your ass. So second test is all about survival instincts. If her family is against love marriages.. Then it's another level.. Best of luck in level one 'hide and seek'. 
The law of four walls. Any kind of romance is only permitted inside four walls. Unfortunately for our eyes that we can't see couples kissing or hugging in public.. Not even holding hands. I have no idea whether they will hold hands inside four walls. Wrong place dudes! You can do alot of different stuff if you did these Somewhere else ! Since parents hide all the acts which express love from children, they make sure that these children stay single forever. Preparing children for arranged marriages maybe! 
Well... Love marriages is this much complicated... That's why we have arranged marriages. Do you feel lucky to have this system after hearing all those. Thers a catch... Here it's basically a job interview. Everything matters. Your education, assets, caste, religion,  looks, size, shape... Well... It's tight competition. 
Some Indian parents restrict girls to hang around with any other people they don't know even if that girls knows them for years. But they will decide the person she shd spend her whole life with some simple statistics based on variables. World runs on maths. 
Since our population Is high. There is atleast million people everyday who tries to understand and make theories about love. Even today morning I saw some post saying that love is not about kissing, hugging and bla bla bla. It's spending time with Someone and bla bla bla... The thing is... It's quite hard to get these kisses, hugs and all in India. And don't motivate them to reduce it. 
Idk from where these people pop up! 
Boys are indeed lucky, they don't have a hymen to protect right. It's truth that womans virginity is over rated in India. Whenever you ask someone regarding this.. They'll say... What if he gives you a child and ditch you before marriage. What we can learn from these it... People still don't believe in condoms! Simple as it is

what exactly is the benefits of being in relationship in India. Well it depends... There are modern people with modern mindset here... So... Pick wisely... And unfortunately if you fell in love with a traditional girl. It's quite hard... But sometimes love just don't make any sense! Get married fast and make sure your children don't face the same stuff !  And it's ok to hold her hands, kiss her lips, hold around her waist, express how much you care and much more in front of your children.And dont lose control infront of them. You know what I mean!. Be you children's first teacher of love too. Our system is stupid... But it's our choice after all... Whether to run your life chained in the rhythm or not. </div>
