I liked the fact that students blame teachers for letting them copy and teachers blame students for not keeping ethics.
 
Everyone is having some guilt upon them. But all are like
"If I didn't copy... And others copy... I'll get the least marks"
 
Wtf... Accept it... You are dumb lazy to study in the comfort comfy zone of your house.
 
Everyone is legends in pretending they are goddamn angels...
Which they're not..and I'm not either
 
Why can't we accept that we are also evil in some sense?
