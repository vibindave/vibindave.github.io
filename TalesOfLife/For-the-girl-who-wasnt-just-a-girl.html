                        <div class="story-container">There was a girl
Who felt to be a pearl
Daring and dashing
Like a glittering obsidian
I used to be proud
To be in her friend's list
I used to sing her praise
And it felt like a pure melody
The one never said
"I'm just a girl"
But one day 
Something slithered her heart
But I didn't knew
She'll turn into a moron
Crying and weeping
Forgetting who she was
She feeded on her fears
I waited and waited
To see the rebirth of phoenix
Now I feel the fear
Of losing my old dear
Remember this
Life is a journey 
You can't skip the darkness
Figure out the short cut
To the next junction of happiness!
I'm waiting
To see the girl who wasn't just a girl</div>
