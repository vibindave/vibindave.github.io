It was another day and I was still alive. I couldn't find out a way to sleep more cuz it was almost noon. Sun was blazing in my face. I could feel the heat of the rays through my old bedsheet.


It has been three days since I got something to eat properly. My stomach has been calling me names for days. I rolled over my rugged bedsheet and kept In my sac. I couldn't even stand properly. Two days before a policeman used his stick to beat me and wake me up. My fate, it went on in my ankle.
He said I should not sleep in railway platform. Why can't I? That was my home for so many days.

I can't bear these mosquito under this bridge and I don't know when I will get snake bite here. Anyhow better than suffering from hunger like this!

I was sinking in my morning thoughts but suddenly my stomach said!
"Ey you buffoon , find something to eat "

I came to the main road and started walking. Legs were already like paralysed . Three days before I remember eating those remains of marriage function from garbage cans. It has been months since I ate like that. So tasty and I nearly broke my teeth chewing those bones.

But after that I couldn't find anything to eat . And I found out even water has its own taste! I came across the garbage can where I found those marriage remains, but municipality has already cleaned it up.

Today also I planned to go and beg near temple, but people ignore me since i don't have any visible damage . I tried to make me dirty as possible. And I'm worst at acting. but I've tried few times like cripple when I couldn't bear my hunger.

I saw a big house… I went to the gate, checked for dog sign since I have alot of history with dogs. And started shouting as usual. Sound was not coming out of my mouth. I felt like sand is grinding inside my throat.
"Maa…. maa… some food "
As usual no one came out.

One child showed up in veranda but a lady came from inside the house and pulled that small child inside.
Ive seen the same scene many times. It must be that child's mom.

But Where is my mom? I don't like when I start to think abt her…And currently I'm so tired to think .

I lost hope in that home and decided to reach temple as soon as possible.

Temple was almost empty and many of my fellow beggars were already frustrated. I took my place in a corner and drank some more water which I had with me.

A family arrived at the entrance in their car. I was distracted by the beauty of the car. I've never been inside a car. Once I tried to see inside a car suddenly a sound came from it..

"Beep beep beep" … I got afraid and ran away from there.

There was three members in that car. A man, woman and a child. They walked across us like we never existed.. that child smiled at me. Maybe best thing ever happened today…I didn't smiled back since I was afraid whether child will get fear because of my teeth.
Yes, Ure right. It happened once

They went inside the temple . I saw that man putting a big money note inside that money box . They came outside. Everyone streched their hands for something but they ignored us and left.

From last week they're not letting us inside the temple. I guess God got angry with us since we're not paying him anything.
My eyes were blurry and stomach was playing drums inside. I decided to sleep for a bit. I had the shade of sheets. I was good at sleeping cuz I slept alot for ignoring hunger.

I suddenly wake up by hearing the bell inside temple. It was already evening and I was feeling like glass pieces are stuck inside my stomach…

I stood up took my sac and started searching for food. I tried begging infront of restaurants, I was really wasted so even I tried searching inside garbage can.

I didn't found anything. I fell down in the pathway. I always knew one day I would die because of hunger but never thought that day will come this soon.

I had no fear of death but I could'nt bear the pain. I didn't knew what to do even I thought to commit some crime so that i can live peacefully for few days. Many of my old friends are in jail. They always say it's better there. But I was not ready… maybe afraid.

I was crawling in pain..but people walked around me.. some observed me for few seconds and some people walked like I never existed.
I stood up somehow and walked to a nearby tea stall..

"Anna .. give some food …im so tired ..I'll die other wise…"

"##&&Γé╣Γé╣ . . Go away…. Just now some customers have came .. Don't ruin my buisness…I will pour hot water in ur face if you didn't go"

I came from there since I knew the taste of hot water before…

I felt everyone has turned evil… Two weeks before I remember that guy… He gave me some thing to eat… One day he even gave me tea..

I sat near the junction for sometime..tried begging the people for few coins …no use…I couldn't bear the pain anymore..

I decided to steal something.

I was afraid but I knew I will die otherwise…

There was a bakery nearby… They kept some cakes in glass boxes…

I started walking around the store.. I was afraid …and thought to give up but stomach was not ready to give up…

I tried to gain all confidence I had in my life…

I ran inside the bakery and took one large cake piece and ran off…

"Theif …theif……" I knew People were running behind me… I was not able to run…

Suddenly I was stunned… A stone hit me in my back….. I didn't had time to scream. I tried to run with all strength I had…
My ankle was weak.. I fell down…

I don't remember anything else.. few people hit me with their legs… I was screaming…

No use …

One guy pulled me up and punched in my stomach…

I couldn't breathe….

I don't remember anything else…maybe I don't want to remember…

I died that day… This is a letter from heaven to all those who helped me live untill that day… And I don't have any anger towards people who killed me…

Atleast I don't need to feel hungry everyday..

"Dedicated to Madhu.. who was killed brutally for stealing food"
