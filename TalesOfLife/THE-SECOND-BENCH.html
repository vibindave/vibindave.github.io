                        <div class="story-container">" Bye mom! I'm leaving ". It was my first day after summer vacation. I was pretty tense since everyone made a fuss about the 10th. I have no idea why people are making this much noise regarding 10th. Well! Can't help. 
" Okay kanna, be safe. Don't roam too much after school, there might be lightning and thunder. "
" Yeh, I'll make sure to disobey that. "
It was fun to irritate mom a bit. Made my mornings complete! 
 
The weather was gloomy, clouds were almost ready to shed some tears. I Hope I can reach home before they start to cry. I hated umbrellas. 
 
I reached school. That feeling of meeting our friends after a long time is gold!. 
"Divin... "I shouted the moment I saw my best friend!. 
" Dude... Finally! "
We shared all the nonsense hot news of vacation. Divin went to his granny's home. I went to my aunt's home. So we couldn't hang out during vacation much. As usual time started to fly, I don't know why time is so jealous whenever I'm happy! 
 
It was time for attendance. I saw a new face in class. 
"Who's that guy? Sitting on the second bench.? " I scratched Divin's hand. 
" His name is Arvin. He's new. I spoke with him this morning. He's weird but okay. "
"Is he new to town? It's rare that people join a new school for the tenth standard. "
"Yeh maybe his parents got transferred here or something! "
"Haa maybe! "
 
... 
A week passed...
We were having lunch. I heard some laughter from the last bench. Arvin was sitting on the second last bench with his friends. He suddenly grabbed his lunchbox and stood up to leave. His friends tried to make him sit. I understood something was wrong, but couldn't understand what happened. 
 
Afternoon classes were going on. 
" Did you hear something funny? Arvin wore nail polish. "
" But why? " 
" I don't know, But Asif and the team made hell fun of him in the afternoon!. "
" Ohh ... I saw him being frustrated during lunch. "
" Haa. Don't you remember, last year when my sisters kept mehndi in my hand Rohith and Asif were teasing me the whole day. Nail polish is gonna hurt more!. "
I remembered that day, Divin always avoided conflicts but he was really pissed off by evening. We were friends with everyone in class, so we didn't want to make enemies from the bully group in class. 
 
... 
 
Mundane repetitive classworks went on. Mid term examination was around. I was really excited for christmas. I was roaming around a zoology textbook. Divin shouted Startling me
"Bro... You're gawking into the reproduction chapter again? "
"I was just reading, "
Divin showed all of his teeths. I closed the textbook. I can't scold him, our zoology mom asked us to read the reproduction and contraceptive methods on our own. There isn't anything much to teach there it seems. I'll never know why they made this much of a fuss regarding sex. 
"I heard a rumor... " Divin gave me his mischievous look
"What's that? "
" Arvin is gay! "
" Gay? Is this one of the rumors spread by Crooks in our class? " Gay was just a word I hear in jokes and some english films. I'm positive that the zoology textbook sitting in front of me doesn't have this word in it. Thanks to some series and movies, the Gay word didn't freak me out much. 
" I heard from Deepak, Arvin's only friend. He got TC from his last school because of the bullying he faced. That's one of the reasons he's staying quiet in class maybe. ".
It was true, I only remember that Arvin exists in this class when I confront him sometimes. We rarely spoke regarding anything. 
 
It was around 4pm and our Physical Training period. I changed my clothes and came to the ground. 
" Dude... " Divin came running towards me. 
"What? "
" Rohith is beating up Arvin in boys locker room"
"What the... But why? "
"Rohith compelled Arvin to play football with us, but he resisted. It ended up in a fight! "
We both ran to the locker room. Everything was over by then. I saw Arvin sitting in a corner. One of his shirt buttons was missing and nose was swollen. 
"See the baby girl sitting and weeping. " Rohith was standing nearby and teasing him again. 
Arvin seemed to be terrified, he just sat there on the floor. 
"Come let's take Arvin back to class.. " I pulled Divin. 
"Are you nuts? Don't do anything heroic now. They might hurt Arvin more later if you interfere. You know what happened last year right. "
Me and Rohith had a fight last year. I got hurt very badly and it became a big issue in school. 
"That brat deepak might have said to everyone about Arvin. '' Divin muttered. 
I couldn't find Deepak anywhere then. 
 
I waited until Rohith and others went. Thought to console Arvin, but Divin pulled me with him to play football. We started playing football and I forgot about Arvin soon. 
 
I thought everything would go back to normal the next day. But it got aggravated. 
 
Next day I saw Arvin sitting on the second bench alone. Divin told me that Deepak and Arvin got into a quarrel regarding his confiding. I felt bad for him. But I didn't have any answers if he asked 'Where were you yesterday? '... 
 
Everyday I started to notice him now! He didn't complain about Rohit to faculties. But anyhow I know that our faculties always keep a blind face in front of bullying. Maybe he complained, but nothing changed. He became one of the toys of the bullying group. 
 
Days passed, everyone was in exam fever. It went without making much noise. I finally got 10 days of leave which I was waiting for! 
... 
 
As usual, time was cruel since it was vacation. I enjoyed it as much as I could!... 
 
Finally it was our first class after new year. 
Second bench was empty. Two to three members sat on one bench, after the locker room incident. It became Gay's bench. I suddenly remembered all of the past. 
" Where's Arvin? "
" I don't know! '' Divin was busy with something. 
" Why are you searching for that girl, is he your secret girlfriend? "
Asif was sitting on the bench behind me, he was trying to get on my nerves. 
" No... But why are you curious? You want to be my bitch? But I don't take jerks though! " Everyone started to laugh. Asif stood up being violated... 
"Chill Asif... He's just kidding! "
Divin was trying to calm him down. 
"Why are you always interested in fighting! " He murmured in my ears. 
Teacher came into class and everything went back to normal!. 
 
I didn't see Arvin for the next few weeks. I don't know but I was concerned for him. Image of him sitting in the corner of the locker room haunted me!. 
 
...
It was three weeks after the reopening, I saw Arvin. 
"Look who is here! Ms Arvin!! "
 
I heard someone shouting from the last bench. I was getting pissed off! But as usual I kept low.. 
Arvin just came and sat on his bench. He looked pale..
 
It was our lunch hour and I thought about eating in the canteen for a change. After eating I came back to class. Everyone in class was having some discussion. 
"Where were you dude?!!! " Divin seemed like he saw a ghost. 
"What happened? "
Asif and Rohith stripped Arvin in Boys washroom. 
"What? Where is he now? "
"His mom came and took him home. "
I was hell irritated and I heard Asif and team laughing from behind. I wanted to smack his head down to the floor. But maybe I was afraid of another parents meeting or being beaten up by all of them! 
 
It was a bad evening for me. I don't even know Arvin properly, but I felt sad for him... 
 
I walked home with a heavy heart! 
 
... 
 
I was eating dinner with my family. Phone rang... 
"Kanna it's Divin! "
I went and picked up the phone
"Say bro..."
"Arvin committed suicide, he jumped from his flat! Tomorrow is a holiday for school. "
I stood there frozen... Somehow I felt Divin was not worried but called to inform me about the holiday!. 
I didn't hear anything Divin said after that. I don't even remember what I replied. 
 
I kept the phone down and went straight to bed... 
 
Felt like the earth muted itself. A kind of guilt creeped inside me. I could hear my heartbeat. Felt like someone was marching through my skull. 
... 
 
It was the first day after the incident. I sat on my bench reading one of my textbooks. 
" Poor Arvin right! Asif and those morons should be kicked out of school. Who knew... "
"Will you shut up!... " I shouted suddenly. It echoed inside the classroom... 
Divin sat there frozen... 
"What's the difference.? I didn't react whenever he was in trouble, you stopped me from speaking to him. I was a coward enough to stay away from all troubles. If I had spoken with him, If I had stopped these jerks the other day.... He would be still alive. He didn't commit suicide, it's an murder... By each one of us! "
 
I saw Rohith and others sitting quietly behind me! 
 
"You know what? I was afraid of getting a TC because of fights. But today you made me feel disgusted about myself. He deserved to be alive... More than any of you... Any of us! "
 
My eyes were wet... I couldn't keep up my posture! 
 
I picked my bag and walked out of class... I saw that empty second bench! 
 
Sorry Arvin... 
For not standing for you 
For not speaking with you
For not sitting near you
I know I don't deserve forgiveness... 
 
But you deserved to be alive! 
 
... 
'This tale is dedicated to Arvey Malhotra! May no souls depart when they deserve to live.'
