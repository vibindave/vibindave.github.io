                        <div class="story-container">I hope you have seen the video of a woman being stabbed by a person... I posted it in whatsapp status and...
 
I got a beautiful question from someone asking whether I would have reacted when that man was stabbing her...
Well...
Answer is NO
I'm no rambo and I don't think I'll risk my life for a stranger by trying to tackle someone with a knife and who's taunting others by it ... Clearly in that video..first some people tried to interfere ..but they stud back when they were taunted by knife...
 
 
Then what would have I done?
Calling police... throwing stones... Maybe.. (not taking video anyhow)
But I don't think these would have saved her life either...
 
Why did I post it then?
It could have been avoided if he had some sense... And just criticising that part of society...
 
Many opinions are there with those who recorded that video too...
But I don't want to discuss about it since that girl is dead and people are interested to see world through internet than their own eyes..
