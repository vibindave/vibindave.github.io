Life is live to feel.
Once I saw you as mine.
Now I am learning to say "I'm fine."
 
It was not long ago 
And it was not just ego
Whenever I think about loosing that hand.
My body gives me a tremor with rhythm of a band.
 
Always heard love is mad.
But i learnt living without it, is bad.
I was broken when u found me.
You patched it saying "we".
 
Many had a question...why you?
But i was sure that it was only you.
I owe you alot of respect.
Because you made me see life in a new aspect.
 
Most comfortable turned to be mother's womb.
But I felt the same inside your hands.
It came all the way.....
From kissing to missing.
From fighting to crying.
 
It is not a scratch to heal.
And It takes alot to feel.
I don't know whether you know.
Hope is my medicine to heal.
 
I am not broken now...
i don't know how..
I learnt to live.
Waiting for love
