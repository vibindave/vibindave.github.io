Gimme a time machine!!!
 
 
So.. let's talk about "time" today. Time maybe a illusion in science. But it's the GOD among us. It makes us forget things. It witness the death-birth cycle. Stand among us like a spectator in our changes. It's quite marvellous topic in terms of science. We say that time can be manipulated. But does it even matter? Since our "time" can also be considered as something evolve as we evolve. Maybe we can break "time" in Calendar and watch. But can we really break the time which runs along with us?. Ofcourse it's true that maybe in future we can live forever. Maybe we can find a escape from death. But can we escape from time?
 
It's dumb thoughts... But one thing! Time is the most important thing in your life.. So spend wisely
