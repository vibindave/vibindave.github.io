                        <div class="story-container">Those few seconds
That loudness in silence
Piercing through nerves
Turning rational realm numb
 
Was I injured? Or was in a shock? 
I only remember the fear
Felt like a breeze slithering my throat
Unable to utter a single word.
 
Maybe I was afraid of time
Wished that moment will freeze. 
Each moment gathered a million questions
Each moment adding a billion adjectives
 
First time I felt the weakness
Rational realm seemed brittle 
All the theories I know
Turned into fairy tales
 
All this time I thought
People are searching for answers
Now I knew
People are searching for questions
Which doesn't have answers
 
I woke up finally
Summoning my consciousness
"Are you even listening to me? "
"No... I was thinking about something"
"Always do this to me!!! "
 
She never knew... 
That I was searching for more questions
But I'll never understand how
She's the answer to all those questions</div>
