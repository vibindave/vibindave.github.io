                        <div class="story-container">I should attend a house warming function today. I am only interested in food there. And since we are going to buy some gifts . I'm not guilty for eating free food. But why we make things so complicated there also. 
 
I'm not talking about functions and food which are my favorites. I'm talking about gifts section. If someone buys you a gift. Some people expects a re-gift when they keep some ceremony in future. Seriously... you both can refrain from these exchanges for god's sake.
 
I'm not a person who is good with crowds and I hate those people who come and ask me "Do you know/remember me"... The big joke is... They know that I have no clue about them and neither do them about me.
 
I literally want to write the below sentence in my wedding card(I am not this traditional type..still)
 
"Do's
 
Enjoy the food.. chill with your hearts... Reunite with your family...
 
Don't
 
Bully children
Check employment status
Expect any re-gift ('no gift" is also perfect)"
