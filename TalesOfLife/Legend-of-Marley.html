I was just enjoying my laziness untill my mom found out that.
"Few more seconds please"

"No... You should get ready. You haven't drank good amount of blood these days. If this continues you can't be a mom like me"

I was not interested in blood that much. I just wish that I was a boy so that I don't need to hurt these people.

"I know what you're thinking. As always.. But they have a lot of blood and we are just taking some enough to survive ..But don't get killed yourself. If you are afraid, you can go to cattle shed and drank blood from there"

"Why can't we consume tasty nectar as Dad?"

"I have told you already.. we can't lay eggs without nourishment from these blood.. And you have never tasted nectar... So don't imagine it's tasty"

It was truth.. I never tasted it and we were not allowed to eat those

" I'll go and drink blood tonight. I need to meet grandpa before that.. He said he'll introduce me to someone "

"Haa... take some nectar from your dad and give it to him.. you grandpa is already 300 hour old.. but that guy is acting like young always"

I took some nectar from garage and flied to grandpa's house... I was flying through the huge grasses and enjoying the view..

"Marleyyyy..."

I turned back. It was my friend Jo

"Hi Jo.... Why you look sad?"

"Yesterday jwan was murdered while drinking blood"

I felt dizzy and my hands were trembling... She was my friend... Best friend... She was so quick and intelligent among us... Excellent singer...

"But how?"

"You have seen a child right inside the human's house.. she was just singing to that child... But suddenly it's parents came and she got crushed by them..."

"This is 7th friend I'm loosing in last few days"

"I just feel sorry for her... I have already warned her that humans are evil... But she won't accept it"

I felt anger... Sad ...

"Kk Marley, I'm leaving.... I need to look out the eggs of my sister.. Bye"

"Bye jo..."

I was feeling so broken.. but I got used to it... I continued my journey..

Within 167 seconds I reached grandpa's home.. He was sitting on his old leaf chair...

"Hello grandpa... I got you some nectar"

"Thank you sweet heart.. by the way, your voice look heavy..what happened? "

"I lost jwan yesterday..." My eyes became wet.

"Come near dear.. I know how you feel.. I was hopeless when I lost your grandma.. Be strong..."

"But why grandpa ? Why they kill us.. we don't kill them right... They blame us because some of us spread diseases... But we take precautions not to hurt them while drinking blood and we don't know if someone already have a disease right ?"

"There is a big story behind it.. There were three clans Aedes , Anopheles and culex...Most of the mosquitos in the world were plan of these clans ... We used to live in harmony with other animals.. But these humans invented something to eradicate our species.. We ignored first but a large amount of our people were died... Even a Aedes empress was died due to human... So they decided to go in war with humans...people of Aedes made a treaty with dengue virus , Anopheles with malaria and we members of culex clan made pact with many bacterias and virus... That's how this all begun... War is still fought among us... We are the animals who kill most number of humans in this world than any other humans."

"Isn't it bad grandpa? "

"They are killing us everyday. And do you think that's correct? "

"I don't know"

"Either do I ! But we are born to this world with a curse to drink blood... But it's how world works... You can't blame a lion because it kills for survival right? Human kills for the same. They bring destruction wherever they go...

My jaan.. your grandmother was a kind person you know.. she only used to drink amount of blood she required to survive and she never agreed to kill some human"

I saw my grandpa's eyes turning wet.. I was not able to say anything...

"Ok grandpa... I should go.. take care"

"Ok sweet heart..be careful"

I was angry.. frustrated.. Tired.. I was flying back to home with a heavy heart... Then I saw Jo flying towards me... She was crying

"What happened jo?"

"All of my sister's eggs are destroyed. Those humans took those I guess."

I was already sad and it really affected my senses...

"Don't worry jo... We are used to this right... Do you know how to join anti human squad?"

"Yeah.. I know.. you should kill a human to qualify into that... But I don't think your mom will allow "

"But I'm going to do it..."

"You're going to kill that child ?"

"No... I'm not human after all!..."

I directly flied to my aunt.. She was an ex anti human squad soldier... She was reading something ...

"Aunt Carla.. are you busy ?"

"No dear. ..you rarely visit me.. what is the special occasion now?"

"I want to join AHS"

She looked shocked... But she hid the exicted face and asked
" Why now? Suddenly? I never thought you wanted to become soldier .."

"My best friend was killed yesterday and I want to seek revenge "

"Ha ha... 200 hours ago .. I stood infront of my mom when my sister was killed.. it's not big issue to get selected in AHS.. You just need to prove your mental strength by killing or hospitalizing a human"

"Where can I find avian malaria? I donno how to carry them"

"I know a nearby hospital where you can find a clan of avian malaria . But don't get into trouble with encephalitis clan while going there.. you just speak to avian clan and take some people of their clan to a human.. they will do the rest.."

I shook my head and said bye to aunt Carla ... It was already night and I flied fast as I can to the hospital... I went there and found the avian clan...

I told them that aunt Carla sent me.. it seems chief of the clan knew her very well... without any further questions he asked some of his clan members to accompany me.

I flied to the people whom I want to take revenge.. It was dark and it took a while, about 3 minutes to reach the home of those devils.

Somehow I managed to snuck into their bedroom. Two devils were sleeping peacefully after killing my best friend.. I said to myself that I was doing the correct thing. I sat in the woman's hand and injected my skylet inside her hand..

"Ngeeeeeeee"

Suddenly her child started crying . I didn't got enough moments to think.. she woke up and my skylet was stuck . I forgot to inject the anti blood coagulant at correct time I think.. I tried hard to pull it out...

She still didn't see me.. She went near the child and took it in her hand... For one moment I was freezed...
They resembled my mom coming to cuddle me when I gets nightmares... She started singing a tune in that child's ear... Child's dad didn't wake up till now... But it's mom woke up hearing a small cry from her child..

Infact, they are the same. They don't understand our language. They donno who are innocent and who wants to kill them.

For a moment I felt I was wrong somewhere. But still the pain of losing jwan was breaking my senses..

Suddenly she saw me... And I was stuck still ...

{"Hoo sweety... see this mosquitos are drinking your mom's blood..."}

She raised her hand to crush me.. I knew that it was my last moments.. but I had a choice of killing the woman eventhough if I die...

But... I couldn't...

Afterall... I'm not a human
