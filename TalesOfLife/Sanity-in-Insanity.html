                        <div class="story-container">"I'm a science student... I believe in science not in God"! I was fighting with my mom as usual for going to a temple.

I want to spend my vacation in some tourist spot and my mom was planning to make it a spiritual trip.
At last since I was just 18 my mom managed to convince me. I strongly belived in communism and atheism. Also I was a science student. Even though I fight with mom regarding this. Her spirituality will win over my science. Not because she has a point but because she won't accept any facts!.

At last we arrived in temple. Dad didn't accompanied us due to work issues. And I was so irritated because I was not in the place where I wished. But I behaved disciplined because somewhere inside me I had a fear about God since the idea was injected so deep into me in childhood. I believe that that the atmosphere is created inside the temple because of belief but not by God. I love the atmosphere inside temple by the way. All the people will seem happy or filled with peace. That positive vibe is so fascinating. But I believe that is the result of their belief but not GOD.

We roamed around the temple for about 1hr and came back to the entrance.
"Oh god ... I forgot to buy payasam (Kheer).wait here...I'll go and buy it"

"You can buy next time right? There will be long line for payasam. It will take time!" I tried to change her plan

"So what.. you have any meetings with Indian president?"

I couldn't say anything and she left for buying payasam.

I stood there for sometime and searched for a place to sit. There was a bench nearby and I went and sat there.
Suddenly a saint like guy came and sat near me. People passing the bench was bowing to him. I understood that he is quite famous here. He was old. Around 60 but healthy. Wearing a brown saree like thing around him. I got laugh when I watched his attire but I suppressed.

I had pity feeling for the people who believed in God but I had quite respect towards elderly people so I smiled at him when he turned to my face. He smiled back and took water bottle from his bag he carried around his shoulder.

He drank some water and kept the bottle inside the bag. He was not one of the tantri Brahmins who will be clean and chubby.
He had long beard and hair. And some chains over his hands and neck. I kept on staring at him for a while.

"Is there anything you want to ask? "
Suddenly he asked me.
"No..no" I was not expecting a conversation
"I believe in science not in gods" I have no idea why I said that... I felt stupid next moment...
"Even I don't believe in gods"
I was never been shocked like that.. was he kidding with me?
I looked at him like a kid staring at his teacher when he doesn't know answer.
"Are you teasing me?"
"No.. why should I? By the way... Let's keep that secret between us"
"Why do you believe I'll do that? I don't understand.. I don't understand anything and I don't know you!."
He smiled at me....
"What do you think is the meaning of life?"

"I don't know..."

"What are those things that make a life beautiful?"

"Happiness... Love... Family... Friends... Wisdom"

" I never heard wisdom in that list till now... But it's quite interesting you added it."

"But you didn't said why you asked these!"

"What do you think a person will do if he is only treated with happiness?"

"That will never happen..."

"Just imagine...what will he do?"

"I can't tell since I never felt it ... But I guess he'll achieve peace and will be happy forever"

"No.. he'll lose his mind.. happiness is just like sadness..  at some point our mind seek for a change... We'll loose ourself and end up in chaos"

"I doubt it!"

"Why people risk their life for adventures?... They need a change of state from peace to chaos... To be the animal they truly are"

I was not understanding anything... But I liked when he said that we're just animals. Since even I believed in that.

"How many times in your life have you deceived yourself?"

"What? I don't understand!"

"How many times you have done things you don't like for others"

"I guess everyday then!"

"You're taught about making other happy but rarely about making yourself happy..am I right?"

"Yeh... We are taught to be happy as a family"

"Your mom is doing alot of sacrifices for you right?"

"Yes... She did" I remembered about many instances where she took decision for me instead of her

"But she's happy for those! Right?"

"Yes... I guess"

"That is spirituality this world built to conceal the chaos"

"What? I didn't get it?"

"You know about sabrimala Makarajyothi right? Grandest thing ever happens for Hindus in kerala? "

"Yes ... I know... Every year my mom will make me watch it Live in television"

"But makarajyothi is just a star called sirius and makaravilakku is man made stuff"

"Whatt? But why people are still believing then?"

"They are made to believe... The idea is so deep so that they can't take a change..The fact is available online but only few people will read it. Government made that area restricted where they lit that makaravilakku"

"But why?"

"We need a society which runs on justice... Good things should be rewarded bad things should be forbidden... You think it's possible without spirituality?"

"We should give preference to humanity."

"Humanity is just another concept of spirituality. If you don't believe in spirituality you should not believe in humanity either."

"I didn't understand!"

"We are just animals with brains. But we recieve many ideas from ancestors about our past. Where we praise good things and use bad things as scary. Don't worry! Spirituality will vanish once and theories of  humanity will be in action. But it will have less effect since it doesn't offer you anything for doing something good!".

" So you're saying that this is all built for reducing chaos in society?"

"Not only chaos...But everything is predefined in this society... Each person's happiness might be different. But it rarely goes out of the predefined happiness rules of society. We praise love since it has the power to control animal in us"

"So ... we're living inside a lie? What's truth then?"

"I don't know... But I know that world runs on lies... Trying to divide happiness among everyone... Not letting anyone go into chaos.. Average happiness promised for everyone."

"But why do you look like a saint."

"I gave up on lies... When we understand about the world around us.. we'll be so desparate to break the rhythm... But were taught about love and affection so that we can't do anything since our mind works that way...
We have 4 choices I believe.. if you got to know about this real world...
First and most simple one...'Play according to the world rhythm eventhough you know that they're fake, live a life with peace but bearing a horrible truth.' This is followed the most I guess..
Second one 'To leave the chained life and turn to be a outlaw who spread chaos'
Third one' Give up on these lies and To turn himself into a person who gives up everything which are told precious and live only to feed the animal in him.'
Fourth one' they give up their life.. you know about many suicide cases without any resons right?' But I feel that is ridiculous since animals don't suicide. Even that was created by society"

"I guess you're third type.. but you look like a saint... And even now you're lying to yourself right... Because you're not fullfilling the needs of an animal even"

"I said already... To know about this... You should gain alot of knowledge and observe alot... You should experience manythings..

By the time you understand... You'll feel pity about other people and if society had injected ideas of love and happiness more into your head.. you won't become a outlaw who feeds the animal in him...

But you'll become someone who doesn't hurt or introduce chaos...

That's the idea of an society... It's deep... evolving... But it has created alot of precautions not to destroy itself..

And for the saint look...
It feeds me well... I can sit and laugh at people..."

"I don't understand about you... You seem like a astrologer but speaks about astronomy..Why you said this to me?"

"I don't know... Instinct maybe... Maybe I don't want you to destroy the rules of society and introduce chaos"

"You said I have a choice if I got to know the truth... And you should hate society for your situation right?"

"No... You didn't understand the truth... You may even forget this conversation... If you should know the truth.. you should find yourself... Experience yourself...
And I don't hate society...
I don't know... Sometimes I feel the laws of society, spirituality and humanity are built for our well being.. if I had followed them... I don't know..."He turned silent... His face told me many stories.

" So all people like you are atheists?'

"Truth is I don't know... But I know one thing... The people who built this society were not stupids... They tried to built some heaven... But ended up building something in between hell and heaven...A world filled with lies to hide it's flaws"

After saying that he started staring at space.

"Kanna...let's go...I got it... It was long queue so took time" Mom has come back.

I stood up from the bench and walked to the exit along with my mom...

I turned back... He was still staring at the same spot...

I had alot of questions in my mind.
His ideas about life is true?
Or he's just a insane person?

Or Maybe a sane saint who taught me about sanity in insanity.....</div>
