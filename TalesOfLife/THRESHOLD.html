                        <div class="story-container">There is a threshold for everything in this world... We rarely do something which doesn't give us any profit.
The profit maybe...
Emotional... Physical... Material etc...
Even when you do some social work.. there also... You find peace... Or some satisfaction...
 
In childhood we used to do things for curiosity or to learn/observe... Sometimes I feel, we did somethings without any profit then.
 
But we portray human as good as possible so that we don't feel guilt for manything...
 
It works...
maintains us away from chaos...
 
But in turn... Relationship ruins due to this...
 
Don't ask people to be perfect.. they will be trying their max if they love you... And if they get what they expect... Relationship will last forever...
 
It maybe love...physical.. emotional.. etc
 
Life is so simple...when you start to communicate from your heart...
 
But it comes along with a starting trouble... But you'll get used to it when you start...
