                        <div class="story-container">Few months ago, I got myself into a freaking question... What's the most mysterious thing in this society? I guess it's diversity in prespective..
For example... Why many people like joker character even though in "dark knight" movie director wished to prove that the prespective of joker is wrong ?
Actually directors just kept climax as "good" according to the society. But in whole movie, director was showcasing his own rage against society and people took that rage inside them... "A hero for the suppressed community"..
 
Alike that in king kong vs Godzilla movie. They are killing millions while they fight. But no one cares about those people. We only cheer for the giants. That's the steering wheel of focus. Our mind is so gentle that it will get manipulated easily. And we have a bad habit that we are so bad at changing a perspective in our mind which was stable for a while..
 
So pick the prespective wisely... Next time when you cheer for the war... Try to think about the soldiers who die... The irony is.. people who started the war will die in climax and no one care about the millions die in between.
