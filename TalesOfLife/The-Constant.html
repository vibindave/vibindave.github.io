                        <div class="story-container">" Dev ! Tomorrow our children are going to college. Twins are really excited for the first day" I just woke up and came to the dining hall where my dear wife was screaming at my head.
"Calm down... Feels like you're going to college" I was still half asleep. 
" I wish I did " She smiled at me. I will never get tired of her smile. I grabbed her around the waist. She was making tea. 
" Morning itself started ah? Let me make this tea at least "
I kissed her on the cheek... 
"Kissing you before brushing is always fun" 
" You won't change..." She pushed me with that adorable giggling. 
 
"You guys are unbelievable. It's been 20 years you guys! " Dvan was standing next to the dining table. Laughing at us! 
 
"Go get a girlfriend buddy. No use in getting jealous here." He might already have a girlfriend. But this smart ass won't tell me. He's too cool to be single. I can't believe him when he says he's single. 
"Don't you have any good advice to give to him? Tomorrow he's leaving for college.! "
"Don't worry about it mom. Anyhow I don't need to see these old romantic scenes everyday for a while. " He always makes fun of me. Can't help, after all he's my son... 
"Where's my favorite twin? Your sister? "
"She's still sleeping. Maybe waiting for her daddy to wake her up" Jenn got all her bad habits from me. I'm proud of her for that. 
"I hope that girl finished her packing. I lectured her whole yesterday about hostels and all. I am still worried. These two will be in two different colleges, that too both miles away. My heart sinks whenever I think about it. " 
Madhu was about to get emotional. 
"Oi babe... Don't start now! They're 18! Not 8"
"You first brush! " She rolled her eyes as usual. Well... That's a warning. 
I picked my brush without picking a fight. 
"Dvan, Are you coming to play tennis? "
"Sure!"
We both drank tea and came to the backyard tennis court. Played three sets. As usual he won 2 and I guess he let me win one. He's too mature and sometimes too proud to show his love.
I got tired and went and sat on a bench in the garden. Dvan came and sat near me. 
"Are you ok? " I asked him. I don't know why. 
"I'm good. Maybe a little bit tense over college. "
" Do you want some advice or should I avoid it? "
" Na.. Give me what you have. Let me hear what you have to say! "
" You might make some mistakes and it's fine! "
"What!? How's that good advice? " He laughed
" You care too much about your ethics and stuff. I don't remember you doing something wrong. Or hurting someone. That's good, but... Don't lose hope in yourself if you fail in keeping these standards or make wrong decisions. "
" Feels weird, but I'll keep it in mind. Anything else ? "
"Make a lot of friends! Get yourself a girlfriend. Try not to break someone's heart. Especially yours... Make a lot of memories. Don't do something wrong if all others are doing it. Break some rules but it should not affect someone else's life. Stand on the right side even if you're alone. And... "
" Dad! "
" What happened? Boring ah? "
" No... Actually I'm afraid that I'll not have a college life like yours! " He kept his eyes away from me. Why is this guy so shy to show some affection?! 
I smiled... 
" I don't know how you decided that I had a tremendous college life. But it's hard to reach my standards." I poked him. 
He giggled just like his mom. 
"The secret is... We can't predict something. We can decide how to shape our present. So do it the best way. I'm sure that I'll get jealous of your college life."
"Yeh... I'm waiting for that! "
We both laughed. He kept his head in my lap. He was a proud little man who was filled with love and covered in sweat. 
 
We both stayed in the garden For next 30 mins. Playing some jokes on each other. But I was sure that I'm going to miss him. 
 
"Dadddddd.... " Jenn had woken up. She was shouting from inside.
 
"Looks like a little evil baby has woken up. Let's go inside. "
 
We both stood up and went inside. 
 
"What happened Jenn? "
"Mom is not letting me pack some of my dresses!."
"Why is that madhu? "
"Some are too short Dev. "
"Cmon madhu... It's 2045! People are roaming naked here."
"Do whatever... You and your daughter will never listen to me! "
I winked at jenn. She quietly escaped to her room to add those dresses in her luggage. 
I took a shower and came to eat breakfast. All the other three members were already present at the dining table. 
" Dad, will you take me shopping? " Jenn asked. 
" For what? " Madhu was not ready to cut some slack. 
" Don't worry Jenn, I'll take you. Anyhow I can't take you shopping for a while now right. "
" You're the one making our children spoil. You know, right? " Madhu was not having a great morning I guess. 
" Chill babe. You also come. Dvan, you wanna come? "
" No... I need to say good bye to some friends "
" Oh Kk then "
 
We completed breakfast and set out for shopping. 
 
" What do you want to buy, Jenn? "
" Nothing actually! Just want to check whether I missed something required for college "
" Madhu, let's go shopping. We can roam for a while. "
" I know where I'm going! " She was driving the car like she wanted to hit someone. 
" Go slow ... "
 
We reached there in 5 mins. Thanks to our Formula One driver! As usual, Madhu was the one doing all the shopping. Me and Jenn were just roaming around. 
 
We both went and sat in an open restaurant nearby. Madhu was still picking up something for Jenn. 
" No advice for me dad? " Jenn asked. 
" Dvan told you ah. You two speak more than I expect. And why so, I hope your mom has already given you more than enough! "
" Her advices were boring " 
" Do you know what's the most beautiful thing about your mom? "
" Donno... She's hard working though! "
" No... She's independent. I don't know what advice she said, but she said all of them with her experience. "
" You want me to follow those? "
" I don't think you'll follow any advice. "
" That's true, " Jenn smirked at me. I knew I'm going to miss this girl at that moment. 
" Keep one thing in mind. Be ready to face whatever comes to you. It doesn't matter whether it came by chance or choice. You're responsible for your happiness ,career or anything. No one else! "
" You make me feel like I'm going to end up in some trouble" 
" I'm sure you'll. You're my daughter after all. "
We both laughed like hell. I'm sure that everyone in that restaurant noticed us. 
 
" I hope you're not making fun of me. " Madhu was standing behind us. 
 
"Yeh we were," Jenn said. 
"Wait till you reach home. Jenn, go and buy some snacks of your choice. " I will never understand whether to adore her caring or get scared of her scoldings. 
 
Jenn went to buy snacks. Madhu sat near me with her hot air filled face. 
" Are you okay baby? "
" What? " 
" Don't shout... I understand you're upset. But I don't think it's mood swings"
Madhu was silent. 
" I'll miss our kids. " I saw her eyes. Clouds of tears were already forming inside it. 
" Me too " I kept my arm around her. She kept her head on my shoulder. 
 
" Well.. We'll have some space after all. Like newly wed couples. "
" You won't change..." She pinched me. 
Her tears finally fell on my shoulder. But she was smiling. That smile contained a lot of emotions.

Changes are always hard. Even more exciting. After all, change has been the only constant in this universe till now! Life will find its own way to move on.
