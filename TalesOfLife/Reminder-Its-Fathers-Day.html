                        <div class="story-container">The day arrived again
He was so thrilled
He didn't forget to "video" call
Far far away
Someone was waiting for that call
 
He was busy whole day
But his calendar made him remember
That the day was "Father's day"
He rushed himself to his laptop
His Adam and Eve was waiting
"Happy father's day dad ..."
 
The words were short
Language was Rap
Still everyone laughed
He allocated 5 mins for them
Proud he was, about his love
 
Ofcourse they were
Proud of each other
Dad who sketched his son
To live his dream 
Son who lived his life
Upto the tantrum of expectations
 
They were happy
But they rarely met
They became rich
But now they rarely reach
To hold each other
 
They couldn't question anything
Everything was perfect
As they dreamt 
But a void was building
They couldn't find anything
To fill the space
 
They justified their reality
"It's how life works"
Maybe it was true
We'll never have any perfect answer
In chapter called LIFE
Maybe we don't search for it
Cuz it breaks the chain of rhythm</div>
