Which I try to solve everyday
But always last piece slips away
Like a jigsaw puzzle with missing pieces
 
Whenever I felt I solved the thesis..
It smiled at me saying!
"It was the wrong piece"
Even though it makes me wander,
I wonder why I can't leave it
 
Amigos accompanied in solving the case
At last they became victims of case.
I know many explorers...
Those trying to find the solution
Some says
"I heard 'they' found the solution"
 
Atlast oneday someone asked!
What makes you to try again?
I ignored with a portrait smile.
But that question had depth!
I'm not searching for solution
I'm enjoying finding the solution!
 
A path filled with all emotions
From sweetness of happiness
To bitterness of sorrows
Accompanied by alot of ghosts
 
No one knows the solution
No one needs the perfection
enjoy the wandering
In the world of mysteries
 
Imperfect things are more beautiful
