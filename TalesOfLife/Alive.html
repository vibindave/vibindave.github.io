"Good morning Dave"
I felt like I woke up after a long sleep. It's been a while since I slept like this. I got out of bed.
"Good morning sir, would you like to take nutrient tablets for the day?"
"No need Ophera. I don't feel hungry. I ate my last nutrient capsule just 3 days back." Ophera was a 215.081 model robot assistant made for health care and household maintenance and Optura was my personal assistant. I guess I interact with these two more than anyone in this universe now.
"Would you like to run a taste bud simulation for any legacy food items?"
 
"No, I'm fine" I miss those days when I could eat real food. 
"Optura... What is my schedule today?"
 
"Today you have an appointment for tissue replacement and cell maintenance . Later there is a party with your friends JO X15, Raj N87 and Diva B21. "
 
"Any other notifications? "
 
"You have received payout of your three servant robots working in their respective fields. Your request to have a human baby is rejected. And....
 
"What? Not again... I'm tired of the company of robots around me. What's the reason they gave? "
 
"They are not allowing new offsprings until we find a new planet to build another habitat"
 
"These mor#ns.. I know that these people have found at least 5 more planets and built habitat there. But they're only allowing the rich people to produce offspring. Anyhow, no use" I was already tired of this government. But if I say more words. They'll come and arrest me for violating the code of respect. I tried to calm myself down.
 
" Anything else Optura? "
 
" Your girlfriend Dia H71 has revoked relationship status with you. "
 
" That's fine. It's been around 4 years. It's time for a change "
 
"Ok Optura. I have one interaction today, isn't it?. Let's move to the interaction room."
 
Interaction room is still something which creeps me out. It's been a while since I met someone directly. Maybe around a year. It's simple science, we can connect two interaction rooms from any corner of the universe. If two interaction rooms are paired. It's a kind of wormhole. Travelling through space with a blink of an eye. When the connection is established. Two different rooms become one. It syncs the time and space around it. We can use it to travel from one place to another or use it as a conference room. 
 
We entered the room, Since Optura takes care of all settings and pairing stuff. I don't even know how that works. Within seconds my doctor arrived. He also pulled inside a trolley with some equipment. Whenever someone comes through that door of the interaction room I get a strange feeling. Like ghosts passing through a wall. Slowly his body parts became visible one by one.
 
"Hello Dave B17, Hi Optura"
"Hi 7754321 " Optura replied. Of Course you guessed correctly. The doctor is a humanoid robot , just like Optura. Optura is just a pet name I gave to her. I was not interested in calling her with set of numbers. Doctor is more advanced version of robots. With powerful analysis tools like EM scanning. He can see through my body. They scan our body in different depths and form a 3D model within seconds. A walking multi speciality hospital.
 
"Hi doctor..." 
"How you're feeling, last time you had a check up before 15 years. It's been a while since you had a checkup after that."
 
"Yeh, when you're living like an immortal for more than 2 centuries, you'll get less excited about our physical condition. Moreover I guess my whole body consists of artificial transplants now. I can even control my sensations." 
 
"Ha ha... You are always funny"
 
"You are seeing me for the first time. And you're speaking like you know me for forever"
 
"Ofcourse I will know you forever. I have downloaded all your past interactions with other doctors and analysed it. So I guess I can use 'always' in my sentence"
 
"Sometimes I can't even believe that you're a robot."
 
"Ha ha.. let's move to the analysis"
 
He turned silent and started staring at my body. This part always gets me.
' Body scanning on progress '
' 3 sets of tissue damage found '
' body scanning completed '
' No errors found in bionic implants and integrated add-ons '
 
"Dave B17, it seems we need to replace three tissue sets in your body. Shall I proceed?"
 
"Yeh sure, I give permission to make changes in my body. And you don't need to add my surname always when you call me. Keep it Dave. This is not some boarding check, right?"
 
"Sure Dave" he smiled
 
We all carry a small usb port T  behind our neck. To configure our bionic implants, control simulations and add-ons.
 
Doctor connected his system to mine . I was falling asleep. He might have initialised the tissue replacement command.
 
.
 
"Dave...Dave... you can wake up. The procedure is over."
 
 I slowly regained my consciousness. 
 
"Do you wish to look at some new add-ons?"
 
"No doctor. I still haven't tried all the add-ons and virtual world simulation which I installed last time."
 
"Fine then. Have a nice day "
 
"Thank you doctor"
 
We both came out of the room.
 
"What's next, Optura?"
 
"The party with your friends starts in 1 hour"
 
"Ok. Let's prepare things for a party"
 
" I have already set up all requirements sir " Ophera showed up 
 
"You guys never allow me to do anything ..." 
 
"Sorry sir, I thought you'll be pleased. Should I undo all the preparations I made so that you can do it on your own?"
 
"No Ophera, it's fine"
 
"Optura , they're coming here or again it'll be a holographic party."
 
I still haven't got any updates from them. I'll ask for updates soon.
 
I went and sat on my bed. I started thinking about my childhood. I was born on the zeptron planet. One of the first human base camps after Earth got destroyed. My parents were so sad, always thinking about their childhood. But they never shared their feelings. Anyhow I understood that they missed their planet. We created artificial replicas of almost everything that existed on earth. But they always say that something is missing.
 
Now I'm sad thinking about my childhood. It's been almost 2 centuries. Now the human race has developed in a way that technology is saturated. But still they're extending their empire.
 
"Hi Dave, you seem worried!"
 
Optura was staring at me. She became my personal assistant around 30 years ago. She always changes her looks frequently so that I don't get the feeling of repetition in my life. Now she has taken the look of a teenage blonde. She looks so hot actually. She knows me so well that I feel like she can predict my actions sometimes.
 
" Optura ... You're looking so beautiful today! "
 
"Oh.. thank you Dave" her new voice was also so soothing. She was blushing.
 
"I slowly went near her and kissed her" 
I guess you already got to know that we have had sex before. Sometimes I totally forget that she's a robot. But she's the one who pushes my sensation too far.
 
I only keep human relationships for name sake. For love... Because I'll never know whether Optura loved me. It's just a robot. Programmed without any free will. Once I was so 
Possessed by her, I tried to treat her like a slave. But still she never tried to hurt me. She always loves me . I hope soon they'll make her more realistic, with anger, jealousy and all those things.
 
Then I'll stop being in a relationship with a human ,once and for all! After all, currently no one makes me feel the way she does. 
 
We had our time and I couldn't stop thinking about my stupid theory of falling in love with a robot whole time.
 
A hour passed
 
"Dave .. it seems that your friends have opted for a holographic party. They said their credit balance is low and they don't want to spend it traveling through the interaction room."
 
"Those punks... Always they do this. Tell them that I'll pay for the credits"
 
"They haven't booked the use of the I-room. I don't think they'll get access now."
 
Maximum number of pairing at an instance was controlled by the government so that there will be no overloading and errors. We need to book the slot unless it's an emergency.
 
After a few minutes our prestigious holographic party started. We became used to this and now we started to feel that this is a normal party. We had some drinks , watched one movie together. It was about a couple living on earth . I guess all of the actors are also robots . All Stories about earth freaks me out. I can't believe people used to live like that. On this planet I can't even go outside physically because of the temperature. But we can travel through many places through virtual simulations. After watching the movie we played a multiplayer virtual simulation game.
 
It was an old game from earth. Named football
 
Current generation of virtual games are more realistic than before. When I connect my usb into the gaming box and initialise sync. I feel like I travel inside that game. I can feel fatigue ,pain, adrenaline etc. 
 
We played for a while and came back offline. After playing the game we will still have that sensation of tiredness and fatigue in our body. We can choose whether to keep it or refresh our sensation system by resetting it. But usually we don't reset it ,so that we feel the josh of the game for some time.
 
Party ended and we all were pretty tired. Raj and Jo refreshed themselves by resetting their body. I didn't because whenever I do that stuff I feel like a robot. Diva looked so dull. Usually she's the one who becomes crazy at parties.
 
Raj and Jo disconnected from the party. 
 
"Dave... Shall I ask you something?"
 
"Sure Diva, what's the matter?"
 
"I'm feeling kind of strange, you know my friend Jua right? She terminated her system last month"
 
"Really? But why?"
 
"That day she called me and said she's tired of this life. She said she doesn't feel alive anymore. Not like a human. We rarely even speak with each other now. We rarely meet each other. She was trying for the license for an offspring. That was also rejected I guess"
 
Suddenly some shiver creeped into my head. These are my thoughts too. I remember thinking about this. Is that mean...
I'll also end up in suicide soon...
 
I tried to wake up from drowning into those thoughts
 
"Don't worry diva. She lived her life. She lived for around 100 years. Sometimes people get bored of life. Don't stress on it"
 
"I'll try Dave, it was really a shock for me. Anyhow I'll leave now. I'm not interested in troubling you"
 
"You need a sleep. Feel free to talk with me whenever you wish"
 
She disconnected her call
 
"Optura... What do you feel about Jua's words? "
 
"Nothing particularly Dave. I just felt her mind was over thinking about her repetitive life"
 
" I guess so "
 
"Ok.. good night Optura, I'll go to sleep wake me after 12 hours"
 
'''Turning night mode on''' (Ophera)
 
" Good night Dave "
....
 
Optura connected her system with Dave's system using usb to make him sleep.
