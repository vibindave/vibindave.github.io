Megha
Which standard?
8-A
….
I was having some conversation with newly elected class leaders to vote for me in School Parliament. I never thought I was speaking with someone who was going to become a special page in my life story.
“Don’t forget to vote for me, ok? “I was actually speaking in bold voice but using requesting type words.
“Sure brother, even if you don’t request, I was going to vote for you only “She said.
My heart sank, (yeah, who don’t like praising) But regaining the tone I said
“Did anyone say that call a senior ‘brother’ first itself so that he won’t come behind you for love proposals “
“Yeah, you got it “
Actually, I was expecting some other reply… I was shocked for a second and started laughing…
We two were laughing, I understood she was a perfect rival for me…
….
We were becoming close each day whenever we met. We never ignored a chance for irritating each other.
….
I was so arrogant those days, A large peer group, A heroic kind of life.
….
A meeting was going on in science club, A famous personality was conducting a interaction session with students so teachers were selecting a student who can speak about SCIENCE in the meeting held along with the guest to represent the School.
As I was a person who never spoils a chance to boost my name and so-called talent, I was also in audition. Since I was there many people left the audition. Not because they were afraid of me, But I was favourite of Teachers. They blamed nepotism for that. But five students were there…
I asked teachers whether I can talk last so that I can understand the standard in which I should talk. Since I was favourite, they allowed…
But Megha came near me and asked me to go in 4th position. I was actually so attached to her so I agreed.
I went and talked about Schrodinger’s cat, Quantum physics, and all theories I found enough to influence those teachers…
I finished my talk and Megha came to talk. I was having a smile at her like ‘what you can do more than me!’
She started…
I know everyone is so excited and thrilled after my brother’s talk. But Let me ask a question. Did you find anything in those which relates to your life? If no, that is not the science we should know first…
 
I was like….. “ohhh man… you cheated” But actually she was right. Even I didn’t find anything relates to my life (As a 10th student)
She went on and spoke about throwing stones for getting mangos and related it with Parabolic equation. She said why there is a red line in railway station and why we should not stand near running train. She said why we are building well and pipes in circle not in square and many more. All simple things. But those were powerful enough to induce interest towards science more than my quantum physics.
When she finished the speech, I was the first one to start clapping… I was also someone who relates life and science. But I chose my opportunity to show off my knowledge.
Teachers were not so interested because they were aiming to impress guest but not to inspire. They selected me. But I was not ready and I spoke with teachers about her speech and how it influenced me as a student. At last, they agreed.
….
Brother…
I turned back and I saw Megha standing in front of me panting.
“I got this from him “She handed me over a hero pen.
I ran my eyes through it and asked whom?
“That interaction thing happened yesterday, Chief guest gave me this as a gift,”
“Congrats dear “
Actually, I was bit jealous, But I don’t know. I was happy for her…
….
I was eating my lunch from school itself because it was free and I didn’t want to carry lunch box as a weight. I will skip many lunches for playing football. Maybe that’s my secret of stick body.
One day I chose to eat.
I found Megha when I was searching for a place to eat after taking food from mess. She brought food from Home but came to mess for eating along with her friends…
I sat beside her… I found something interesting in her lunch box and I asked her… Wow..grand lunch ahh..
She smiled and gave her lunch box to me and said, You eat, ill take yours…
Are you sure? Yours seems more delicious…
No eat. You seem more interested…
Actually, I was Interested…. So, I took her lunch.
“OMG, It’s so good. Your mom is nice cook”
She smiled and we started eating our food.
….
That incident was repeating many times, sometimes she even bought two lunch boxes. Sometimes she will scold me like mom for skipping lunch… That junior, senior gap was reducing into nil.
….
Half year passed like one day (Yeah most repeated dialogue) …
We were busy because of arts and science fair competition. Megha was there for maths and I was in science fair. I didn’t go for maths because We two were interested in puzzle category and I already knew her puzzle and I was so sure that I can’t beat her...
My competition stopped in District Level because of nepotism. (Same project won state A grade next year when my junior went with that…Yeah! I was so lucky then)
But Megha won State A grade and became star in School, suddenly many people were noticing her. Until then she was known as my favourite sister, and suddenly She was gaining the attention more than me…
Yeah! I was not so good for that.
….
Teachers were conducting visits to student’s home to congratulate them for winning in State Fairs.
I was also part of the team as chairman… for fun… I can roam without spending a single penny.
I had kept a small gift for Megha…
We went to her home, A normal one, Middle class family. But…
She lost her MOM at a younger age… She never had any memories with her. Her dad will go to job at 9am and returns at 9pm. She didn’t have any siblings. During night she used to spend time in neighbours house if dad comes late. She was the one doing majority of house hold works. She was not ready to eat from mess because it will make dad also eat from outside.
Majority of the food which I was stealing from her was made by her. During Saturdays she used to spend her time with books, there was no one near her home to play with. Sundays she spends each second enjoying her dad’s love.
From her dad I understood majority of days she will skip breakfast because of rush to go to school.
She used to say about me all the time, but for me she was just one in my peer group.
….
I handed over my gift to her, And I couldn’t speak anything Infront of her. I left her home.
I wish I gave her a tight Hug that day. I had a bit arrogance because I was from a economically low family but I was achieving heights. That empire in my mind collapsed in one second.
….
Next day I was eating food in mess with friends, Megha came and sat near me. I didn’t know what to say.
“What now… Sympathy came into head aah” She asked me
“No (Maybe yes) … why didn’t you tell me?”
“I don’t know. from childhood I was being treated by love which was by product of sympathy.
You treated me normal… I have spent nights thinking about a brother like you!”
I found her eyes wet! She might have found mine also
“You are an idiot!!! Where is my food? Mess food is not good, you eat this”
We laughed…
