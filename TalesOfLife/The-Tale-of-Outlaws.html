My day began as usual, without any miracles. After taking a strong tea and taking a shower(I hate to bath in December) i set to school.
The day was special because there was PT period. I was somewhat studious then, after reaching college i found the beauty in sleeping in classroom. I was not listening any classes that day because i was looking forward to the football match in PT period. But something went so weird.

It was English period and we were asked to speak about patriotism.to be truth, I was not big fan of that , just another person who celebrates patriotism on independence day and republic day. My roll Number was 52 so i was sure that my chance will come tomorrow. I was chilling in back bench with my friends, irritating my friends who goes to give their speeches (I'll get it back tomorrow anyhow).I was not listening the speeches.

"How many people pinned the flag provided by our school in your chest proudly last year?".
It was Ritvika… One of the girl with a lot of fans for her beauty. I never cared about her.We were just friends. Just for name sake. But rivals in all aspects other than beauty.(yes..you're right..little bit jealous). Those eyes and long hair. (Yeh , i know what you're thinking. Of course i observed her a lot).

Everyone raised their hands.

She continued, "Where is that flag now ?"

I don't remember actually, i'm not even sure it reached my home that day.

"I asked this question because the next day when i walked from bus stop to school, I saw many flags around the roadside. We all are proud to be Indians but nowadays patriotism is confined to independence day and republic day.I have that flag still with me in my home. It doesn't mean that i'm more patriotic than you. But I believe that patriotism is not situated in celebrating independence day with plastic flags and chocolates wrapped with plastic around it. We're just polluting the environment i believe. Let the Indian flag sail in our heart 365 days in a year without any disturbance. I have a dream to be part of Indian Defense. But i believe in peace more than war. I believe in " All people in this world are part of my family " more than in "All Indians are my brothers and sisters " because India taught me 'vasudeva kudumbakam' and unity in diversity, Thank you. Jai Hind."

God… She got my nerves out…

Infact, she got all our nerves out. I also congratulated her in Lunch break when we bumped into each other.(No NO… I was not into her..or crush thing, But she got my attention more than any girl ever did..Also a kindof respect).

Months passed…We got promoted from 7th to 8th. one year passed like a bliss.
It was august 15th. As usual celebrations went. But there were few changes, there were no plastic flags and teachers distributed laddoos this time. I have no idea whether Ritvika was reason for the change. But i remembered about her. She was there standing with her friends, with her pleasant smile.
I hate when someone succeed in influencing me. But i agree…she did..

again days passed, we got into 9th.

Another unusally usuall day came.
Mam was taking attendence.

"56 present"
"57 present"
"58 absent 59 present"

Everyone was shouting their numbers.
"Poor girl..She's absent today also" My friend said…
Who you're talking about? I asked
"you dunno! Ritvika is absent for a week now. Her Dad was arrested"…
"What?, but why?"
"He's a Journalist, while covering some news in UP, He was arrested.And it was big news, I even saw in news. They kept UAPA on him. " He explained
I was quite shocked because i saw that news but i never knew he was her dad.

I went silent rest of the day.
The girl taught me patriotism..
Now her dad is being accused of involving in terrorist activities…

After two days, she came back to school. I still remember, when she stepped into the class, the students started murmuring and her friends seemed pathetic. They kept a mourning face. I got to know that her dad is still in custody.

That smiling face… She tried to be normal. But she seemed weak. Those eyes were not quite shining as before.
I felt sad for her. But I can't behave properly when someone is too sad. I may mess things up for her.I was more afraid whether she will misunderstand me for taking advantage of her weakness to gain her attention(yes..I was not matured enough..But before one month every boy in this class was trying for her attention).

My thoughts were weird..stupid..But i really wished to talk with her.

she changed alot.

Everyone was busy on themselves. but ritvika was busy ignoring people's changes. She started to spent time alone.

Next day i was returning from computer lab.It was lunch break. I was with my friends. i saw Ritvika walking alone. Her friends were walking in front of her. But she kept a distance by herself it seems.

I asked my friends to keep my notes in my bag and went near ritvika.

"Hello madam"
She turned.. she had a smile..And i was happy for it!
"Madam!! ..Me..? "
"Just fa fun… How are you?"
"I'm fine. Better i guess.. I never thought ull ask that question. You rarely say a word to me"
"Yeh..I know.But today i felt to talk with you"
"Why?"
"Why? I can't speak with you? Should i book some appointment?" (Of course… it was sympathy or empathy…)
"No buddy… You're a celebrity ..we should get appointment!"
"I liked that joke… By the way.. let me say the truth.. II felt you're sad for your dad. I hate to see you this way"
She kept silent
"You have time? I need to talk with for sometime"
"No.. I have few meetings with Indian president tomorrow!"
She laughed. It gave me some relief.
"Kk..wait for me after school. we'll walk together to bus stop."
"Ok madam..see you after school"

We had reached our classroom. And we went to take our lunch.

The truth was…
I was tensed about evening! Alot of questions..
Why she said she want to talk?
How to make my friends understand this scenario. According to my boys, I was someone with least interest towards girls.(Yes..I had a reputation to keep).

Anyhow..somehow i managed my mind and my friends.
we both started from class together. It will take around 20 mins to reach bus stop.

First we both didn't speak anything.. After reaching gate of school i asked.
"I didn't understand what you said "
"what i said?"
"Nothing..say something… You're being silent.I cant understand that language!"
"Nothing particular. I just want to feel real for sometime. Everyone is looking me differently. They don't even mention about my dad. I guess they're making me forget those. But i get unwanted attention in school. I became a discussion topic"
"Haha.. "
"Why you're laughing?"
"You were discussion topic before also Miss world"
This time she didn't laughed but gave me a fake portrait smile.
"Any updates on your dad?"
"No.. KUWJ is trying for bail. But No big updates" (Kerala Union of working journalists)
"Don't worry..He'll be home soon"
"Last day reports came that they have been torturing dad physically"
She turned her head down..I understood she was hiding her tears.
"There's law right..Nothing will go wrong.we'll get justice"
"But damage has been done right?…I'm being treated like daughter of a terrorist..My dad who taught me about India is accused of being an outlaw.."
I didn't got any words for her.
"I'm staying with my aunt now.. Mom is devastated.. Everyday Our home was filled with laugh and happiness.. Now we're refugees in another home"
"Society is crap ..you know that!"
"Have you ever felt sorry for terrorists?"
God!.. Is she trying to be a terrorist in future!
"Why you ask that?"
"Few days before India conducted a air attack on a terrorist hub. Many were killed. We celebrated it! But Did they all deserve to die?"
"You're overthinking… why you think about terrorism now.. Your dad will be home in few days. "
"I just feel that world doesn't run in justice.. Our Army Men gets killed for us and we kill terrorists. Their stories, their families. Sometimes.. We even donno who is terrorist and who are not.. "
"kk..kk..You're going too far… Planning to be terrorist in future or what?"
she laughed
"No..Don't worry."
Those words.. She was hurt badly. And i found some rage inside her.
"I know who are the real terrorists… "
"Who?"
She didn't said anything.
"I miss my dad…"
That made my eyes to cook some tears(I'm a boy…I should not cry.. Rule 452-Society blunders Act)
We were near bus stop by then.
"Thanks…" She said..
"But why?.."
"Nothing..KK bye.. My bus is arriving"
"Kk, bye..see you tomorrow "
..

I was filled with thoughts… I understood that day its is gonna be shivarathri..
The weirdest thing is, day after tomorrow she acted like nothing happened the previous day.

..
Days passed…
within few days our exams were over. And i got to know that Ritvika's dad was released after three months..But they shifted their home to somewhere else. I was sad, because i was going to miss my favorite rival.
..

two years passed!

It was august 15th… I didn't went to school that day.. I was walking to my friends house. A car suddenly passed by. A flag which was kept in that car flew off and fell in front of me. I took that flag. I smiled looking at the flag.

I don't know where are you now!

But you set this flag inside my heart. And you make me think about you whenever i say...Jai Hind!

"Dedicated to all terrorist those who were not "the real terrorists" and their family"
