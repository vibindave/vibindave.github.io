                        <div class="story-container">I had a wonderful question with me... Still I don't have the perfect answer. Let me share it today!
Can a person love multiple people at once ?(love category) . It's quite difficult to answer. We'll fall in love with multiple people for sure... infatuation sometimes. Sometimes attraction due to beauty in appearance or character. I had alot of people in my life whom I had kindoff crush.. But things get weird when you commit to someone. Question changes to.."If you're commited, can you fall in love with someone else"... 
My answer is.. " we won't allow ourself to fall in love... If we are getting enough love (sometimes.. you will be satisfied by giving love rather than receiving).. but if at some point, you're not getting/able to give enough love to someone. You'll start to recognise other sources"...
 
Love is also a quantitative object. People set a standard of love... after breakup, you'll get mental breakdown when you don't receive the amount of love you got or you are not able to love someone else like you did before...
 
Some people will never get tired of loving each other and that's what we call soulmates...
 
In our society, there's a complication... Even if we're not getting enough love, we may hold on to people so that we won't hurt them/family.. Which is toxic.....
 
Don't stop loving someone... Or else, you can't blame someone if they love someone else.. But after losing someone you love... Make sure you don't fall in mischief... Find someone who loves you/(can receive love) more than the previous one...
 
And never ... ever fall in love... When you're hurt/sad
