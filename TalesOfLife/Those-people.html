                        <div class="story-container">In my first year of college. In first few months I didn't had any interaction with seniors. And few of them which I interacted was so punks. Some asked me to call them "Sir". I had a particular attachment towards that word since I had alot of respect towards people I called sir before. And everyone deserved it.
 
I didn't understand what they did so inspiring that I should call them that... So whenever I called some seniors "sir" ,"mam" ..in my heart I meant "jerk.. or "bitch"... I had very serious attitude issues. I got into alot of troubles. So I kept away from those people who made me call sir. But thanks to them. No one ragged me!
 
Then I met them ...
Few people took care of me as their brother. They taught me how to act like a senior. We became a family. I had few people to call whenever I was in trouble. One person even celebrated my birthday ( bought me food ) (He have no idea that... it was my best birthday ever) and took me for a bike ride etc... Another person took care of all our keralities in our college like a godfather. He took good care of me when I was ill...
 
Now they all are going to graduate within few days...
 
I'll miss you guys...
 
You guys were awesome... I'm worst at expressing gratitude... But I won't forget you people for lifelong (atleast for 15-25 years ≡ƒÿé)...
