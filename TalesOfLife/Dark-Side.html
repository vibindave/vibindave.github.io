                        <div class="story-container">Everyone is afraid of talking about the dark side which exists in this society. All of us believe that being optimistic is the key of Happiness. 
 
It's a close call actually! 
 
Years ago when Shakespeare showed courage to inject some dark sides of reality into the blissful drama world, the whole perspective of the literature was changed. People who believe that Romeo and Juliet are the wonderful couple ever existed won't understand this. 
 
I used to a hardcore atheist, Always finding some reasons to show off that people are stupid for believing in God. Later when I grew up, I understood that this concept is damn big. The concept of Karma, doing good things and getting good prices in return. All contributed to reducing chaos in this world. 
 
As usual, one person who believed in this will never hurt another person. They always wait for something good to happen. Thanks to the most beautiful feeling thing ever existed,"hope".
 
It was so easy to find reasons to make people feel stupid for being spiritual. But when I chose to just tease them, there are millions of people who chose to manipulate this crowd. And they all succeeded. 
 
People used this same concept to gain control and trust over others… 
 
Kk… why am I talking about this stuff? 
Let me come to our point… 
 
 
We'll go through some random toxic things happening in this society, but can't do anything about it… 
 
Few days back, I got to know that my best friend is depressed, that too from another friend.She is newly married and her husband was treating her badly. But I couldn't do anything because everyone around me was lecturing me that if I do anything about it, her husband will get angry on my best friend and it'll cause more problems. 
Even though I had enough anger to kick that guy's butt, I stayed quiet because, when your friend is married and if you're a boy, the best thing you can do is to stay away from her. (This law applies to my society) 
 
We all try to normalise toxicity in this world. And it exists in different forms in different communities. For example, there are million people out there who try to prove that being possessive and being a control freak is normal in a relationship. Controlling your girlfriend or boyfriend is normal. There's no concept of freedom or independence anymore. 
 
Being open minded is one of the hardest things to achieve since you need to surround yourself with open minded people. 
 
The concept of marriage itself has enough material for a stand up Comedy. I've written about it here. Everyone tries to wrap themselves in already existing customs and lose the ability to create an individual personality. 
 
There are people who break this chained rhythm, and they belong to another community called outlaws. Don't misinterpret that I'm against the concept of love and more inclined to the sex. All I meant is, you don't need a ring or thread to love someone. As usual the problem behind the concept of love comes later. 
 
 
Love is flawless, but people aren't… People change all the time. 
 
What if someone leaves you after you get into trouble? Or leaves you after they used you for their materialistic gains and leaves you later. If a woman gets pregnant and that person leaves, these insecure feelings also create the concept of marriage. 
 
But I feel like those who care will always care. They don't need an agreement… If a person wishes to leave, mere laws and a piece of paper won't change him. 
 
I feel like marriage is good since after all these years, I know that people can change and I've seen a lot of people who run behind materialistic desires. 
 
Isn't it funny that working for others happiness, sacrificing your happiness, dying for other etc will make you into a hero, but if you are too happy for yourself (arrogant), working for your own happiness (selfish) etc makes you a villain… 
 
I used to speak with a lot of friends without any gender discrimination, but when I got into a relationship, I was forced to stop speaking with my old friends. It wasn't because my girl was a control freak, she was innocent and her world was small. According to these normalised laws in society, she's correct… and her mind was really getting disturbed whenever I spent time with some girl. I chose to stay away since I felt it's not her mistake. 
 
Somehow I started changing according to the normalised laws existing in this society… and I ignored all the toxicity since I had started to feel like I was always wrong. That my perspectives were wrong. I changed in order not to hurt my girl. Love really makes us stupid… 
 
All that time that I lived as a normal human being according to normalised laws sucked in all paths. Something happened and (I can't say that story yet) Just like Einstein found gravity after an apple hit his head (It never happened right? No one knows!)… I found the beauty of being myself again. Here I'm, all weird and messed up… Again! 
 
I wish to create a beautiful world for my girlfriend and I can't do that in that stupid normalised world… Maybe I'm just afraid to live a normal life( I have no idea )! 
 
We all have the ability to live according to our own beliefs. 
 
This world is messed up… Each and every society out there have their own flaws and beautiful faces. 
 
Sometimes it's just dumb luck… 
 
People might change…
Marriages can't save you… 
Your beloved ones can cheat on you… 
You might not get anything back for doing or being good… 
You might not find your chandler/monica… 
 
But you can still find happiness(you might get your phoebe) if you accept all these… And it's so hard when this world echoes about optimistic shit everywhere… 
 
The truth is… 
You don't need to be a hero… 
You might get really fucked over if Suddenly a truck rolls over you… 
Our life is sooo small… 
It's your choices and situations, which decides whether you're a villain or a hero… 
Mathew Perry and Courtney Cox were just acting as Chandler and Monica… 
 
 
So… 
Make sure what you want… 
Try not to… 
Hurt people, because some people are so innocent and prone to be manipulated. It's so easy to manipulate someone who is in trouble… Helping others is just a choice… you don't need to do it if you don't want… 
 
Alike… Hurting others is also just a choice… And you can't expect people to always make the correct choice… 
 
 
To conclude… 
We really need a chapter in education teaching about the dark side of human beings… 
 
Don't believe in optimistic bullshit. Just live and face all the hurdles. If someone hurts you, it's not your fault. Morons exist! 
 
It will seem so easy once you realise this…
