                        <div class="story-container">Let's talk about things which don't make any sense if we analyse. I know that there are people out there who don't make sense but let's keep it in general. 
 
I met a group of people who did a campaign regarding sustainable future stuff, they organised a bike rally with bikes with mileage range of 20-30kmpl. I still haven't figured out how burning that much fuel will help in a sustainable future. It's like creating placards with the label "Don't cut trees". When I was discussing this with one of my friends. He said
 
" Stupid people, I don't do any campaigns but I try do stuff like not using straw. We need to change ourself first"
 
He drinks Pepsi like a cow and he drives a car to his office everyday…That too alone… 
 
Well, isn't it beautiful
 
… 
 
Everybody loves dogs right. I love them too, because they love me no matter how much I irritate them. That's also the reason why there are a lot of dog welfare associations in India but there's no chicken or pig welfare Associations. We love the way dogs love us, and chicken Biryani. 
Let me come to the point
There used to be around 20 dogs at least inside our campus. A newborn puppy was born near my hostel and it became a sensation. He was so cute that he's responsible for half the snapchat and whatsApp stories at that point. He was a star for people searching for a way to maintain their snapchat streak. In return he used to get free food and few crazy people making him feel like a celebrity. He was living his life… 
No I'm not jealous… maybe… 
There were around 10 new puppies there and all looked like they came from poverty-stricken homes but here he was… enjoying his life to the fullest… 
 
That's when I realised, even dogs can't lead a sexy life only with love… They need to be cute.
When I said this to my friend…
"She was like… you're joking… if other dogs got a chance, they might have stole everyone's heart only with love"
She's single and I remember her searching for a breed of dog for about 6 months. Now I know the reason behind both. 
I don't know why my friends' comments are being attached in every part of this blog, you guys are wonderful, makes my life worth living. (I'm just playing safe)! 
 
… 
 
Do you know which is the biggest lie industry in India?It's called a relationship. I always try not to post anything bad about relationships because I'm committed, I'll write about that after the breakup :). Let's go through it briefly for now… 
I've seen a lot of lies used by people to find and impress their partner and most beautiful ones end with "forever". One of my sisters was talking about her ex-boyfriend. I asked her why she broke up with him. She said
 
He kept repeating that he's in love with my soul not my body but couldn't stop asking pics of my body. I couldn't control my laugh in front of her. 
She added
" Being horny is good, but being honest matters more! "
I couldn't accept more! 
 
… 
Few days back I got a call from a Non profit organization regarding donation. I found that call very interesting because he managed to make me hate myself. Guilt tripping is a beautiful mechanism for getting something from a guy who feels good for being a good guy. It's stupid! 
 
He was like
"You won't feel bad to donate a few bucks for helpless and needy children ,right? Isn't it our responsibility to help the needy"… bla bla bla…And 10 mins later I hated myself for having 100 bucks in my bank account. Being broke and being a good guy is not a great combination at all!. 
Fortunately I posted a message in whatsApp story and two members came forward to donate some cash. That relieved me from some guilt. I didn't expect it either! In fact I thought about sponsoring a child yearly expense for each person who came forward that day.I'm so lucky that good hearted people are rare.
I have decided to donate two year expenses to orphan children in the future for those two hearts. (You'll never know if I'll give or not give :))
 
… 
 
I live in a country where 800 crore towers are demolished by spending 20 crore rupees when we have a per capita income of 1.3 lakh. 
I live in a country where I saw a guy laughing because he'll get bail for burning a girl alive for rejecting his proposal. 
 
There's good things too… like those two people who were ready to donate money for orphan children just because of a WhatsApp story. 
 
And don't worry about it… donation is just a choice(I'm kidding… you're not a good guy if you didn't reply my whatsApp story :) ) 
 
 
See you again!
