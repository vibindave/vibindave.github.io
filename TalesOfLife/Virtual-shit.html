                        <div class="story-container">From tommorow the tale of online shit exam starts. I don't know whether I can write blogs in these days. (I should concentrate on methods of copying for the exam). I am really tired of writing such exams. Once I used to feel so guilty even if I copy a sentence in exam from others. Now I'm feeling guilty if I spend time studying.
 
I don't know why people are interested in conducting such exams. I won't blame anyone since my career didn't got stuck due to pandemic. But our educational system is so bullshit. It sucks to be evaluated by the basics of "amount of syllabus you can mug up".
 
I dunno whether I can scribble in next few days. But I'll find time to watch po#n someday so that I won't get depressed by online exams...
 
See you soon! Maybe tommorow.. Maybe after 20th april...
