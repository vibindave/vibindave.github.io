But when I saw you, i fell again in Ur eyes
I thought I would never trust again 
But you make me fell again in loop
I fixed not to say again those words
But you make me say!
I love you ...
 
I remember the way I wasted my tears
I remember the way I boozed all night
That too for somebody who 
was "never the one I need"
 
I thought it was my last time
Fixed not to give a shot again
I don't know what's pulling me to you!
I don't know why my heart says
"She may be the one I need"
 
I loved the way I loved my ex
But I hate the way She left without a word
I don't want one more breakdown
I am afraid to try once again
 
Your words raise my soul from below..
My lips thrive to ask always whether
Will you stay with me forever
But past pulls me back further
 
I know I fell in love with you
Cuz I started to take you along in my dreams
I know I messed up once
wish I won't do it again
