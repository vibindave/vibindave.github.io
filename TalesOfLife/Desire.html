                        <div class="story-container">"Vidya... Where are you? I'm already late for the office" It was 8:30 already and it'll take 1 hour to reach the office in the traffic of bangalore. 
"Coming Vijay, here's the lunchbox. Today your son and daughter made my morning hell. " Vidya kept the lunchbox inside my bag and stood there with her pleasant smile as always. 
“ Today night i’ll be late. One of our colleagues got a promotion. Don’t wait for me.”
“ You said we can go for a date night right?”
“ Oh shit… I forgot, we’ll go this weekend. Ok?. Sorry dear, I need to be there.”
“ It’s ok dear… Take care. Eat your lunch properly “
 
I really felt so bad for her. I said I'll take her out for a dinner date two weeks back. Still I haven’t. Day after tomorrow is our 5th wedding anniversary. She must be expecting that I don’t remember.I will take her out at least on that day.
 
Nowadays all days seem similar to me. Nothing was weird today as well. People who are running all day to keep their family economy in balance, those people who try to keep a portrait smile in front of everyone and build an invisible wall to their personal life and emotions, fake parties etc. A simple humble corporate life. 
 
I reached the office and as usual started to run along the loop. I don’t have much to do these days. After my last promotion as division head, workload has been halved. But as usual something was missing in life. Only thing keeping me running this life was Vidya’s and my children’s faces. I completed my morning schedule and went to the canteen to eat. I had my own cabin but I missed my friends, so I continued coming to the canteen to eat my lunch. 
 
“ Hi Vijay, as usual your wife has made a fabulous lunch for you. You’re lucky to have someone like her. “ Raghu, one of my “friend” was laughing at my lunch. Vidya always made sure that my stomach never got dissatisfied. Ofcourse, I was lucky to have her. 
“ Don’t do too much, everyone knows how your wife treats you like her baby.” We both laughed.
 
I took one crispy piece of potato fry and kept it in my mouth. The sound of that bite came out like a thunderstorm inside that canteen.
“ Wah… ”
When I opened my eyes, I saw at least 20 eyes staring at me. Did I forget to say, you should not make sounds while eating in corporate canteens. Sometimes I do want to eat in my cabin itself because I literally hate table manners. Sometimes I feel these people are born straightly into tuxedos. I want to say to these people that your ancestors were living inside a cave only. Some things are always strange, these same people stay 2 hours in traffic and keep honking even though it's no use.
 
I completed my lunch somehow. The afternoon was as usual, and as always even the party seemed so artificial. I just wanted to go to home and get some sleep
 
I drove home. It was already 10:00 PM. Vidya always used to wait for me even though i’m late. I slowly got in without making much noise. Thanks to technological advancements, someone doesn't need to stay awake to open doors anymore. But most of the days vidya preferred staying awake. I have no idea what I did to get this girl.
 
I saw Vidya sitting in the dining hall, I was shocked suddenly, she was crying.I saw tears rolling in her cheeks. I thought about running near her. But something stopped me.She didn’t see me. I went a few steps back and made some random sound in the hall.I went back in the direction of the dining hall.
 
“Vijay?...”Vidya slowly came near me. I noticed that she had wiped her tears. She kept a normal face. But I could see the tiredness in her eyes.
“You didn’t sleep ah? see , your eyes are looking like it’s gonna burst.”
She smiled as always.
"Did they sleep? "
"Yeh… he stayed till 9 :30 saying that he'll sleep after you come . But later fell in sleep"
 
My mind was blasting with questions.Why did she cry? Why did she hide it from me?.
But I couldn't figure out any difference in her behavior. She rarely cried, which made my mind more stressed. Should I ask directly. But what if she asks why I didn’t ask before.
 
We both went to bed as usual, Nothing was different from her side. She wrote her diary as usual. Said the usual good night with that beautiful smile and slept.
That night, my sleep went on a vacation. 
 
She was someone who would sleep like a pig. I always get jealous of her sleep. Today I was totally blank. 
I didn’t know what to do. I was thinking about how to find a solution to my questions. I got a stupid Idea. To check her diary. It was cheap, But i was her husband. I have the right to check. It’s not like I have doubts about her, But i wanted to make sure she’s alright. I listed all possible justification in my mind to do something stupid as that. I wanted to know why my wife cried.
 
I slowly got out of bed, took her diary and went to the balcony. Moon was alone, just like me. All the stars have abandoned him today. I took my seat in chair and opened the diary
 
I opened today's page using the bookmark thread in the diary.
Which instead gave me a lighthead since it only had two sentences.
‘ As usual
Just another day. ‘
 
If it was just another day, why did she cry? Did she lie to herself in diary? Or does she cry everyday? My heart became somewhat heavy. I opened the previous page, it said the same.
‘ As usual
Just another day ‘
 
I turned back a lot of pages. Around 40 of them repeated the same sentences. Finally I reached a page where something was written.
 
‘ Today Vijay forgot that it’s the day that we both fell in love with each other. Last year he did the same. But before he used to do something crazy to make me happy these days. Before he used to say that he wanted to celebrate 365 days in a year. Now we don't even celebrate so-called festivals in the calendar or the days we celebrated before. I just want him to hold me for a while, talk with me for sometime. 
He loves me, always working hard for us. But … ’
 
That really killed me half. Am I turning into the so-called husband who goes on a mundane schedule and doesn't care about his wife. 
 
When I turned back, most of the pages were about the same things. Nothing was there which made her words excited. 
 
In between another day caught my attention
 
' Today Vijay caught me from behind and kissed me on my neck while I was in the kitchen. For a moment I went 2 years back. He was so passionate today. We had sex twice today. But sex was somethihg gives me physical pleasure. Today his kiss almost refilled my emotional state. He always tries to make sure that my physical desires are satisfied. But nowadays he seems to forget that I have emotional desires also. '
 
I couldn't figure out why that kiss was different. We had sex atleast 4 times a week normally. I was confused by the term emotional desires. Did she mean that sex is not good as before. Or is it the sex? Am I not making her satisfied? 
 
As you know, this question is the one which causes more damage to one man's pride. Social convention tries to make it the man's responsibility to make sure women are satisfied. But I felt, it was not about sex. Because I have seen how her body reacts right! But what are these emotional desires? 
 
I turned a few more pages. 
'I don't know what happened to Vijay, he didn't even come home early today even though it's our children's birthday. Of course he just got a promotion. And I was the one who always pushed him to excel in career. Did I do this to him?. He doesn't even play with the kids anymore. Am I being so dramatic here. He tries to find time for us during weekends. But most of the days he's too tired and he even stopped taking leaves since it'll affect his promotion. I am the one who said to try for promotion. But…I feel so ashamed of myself. I myself decided to stay home and take care of the children. He was ready to do the same instead. But why can't I manage a life like this? Why I am so frustrated. He's doing everything he can. There's no point in scolding him. But what's wrong with me? 
I just want my old Vijay back. At Least once in a month. I want to feel the adventure, affection, once again. '
 
So… it's about the way I treat her and children. It's true, I have been trying hard to connect the two ends. But there are holes in between. I was too focused on sacrificing my own happiness for others and expected that, It's all they want. 
 
But how much have I changed? 
 
I needed answers for it. It was time to re-evaluate myself. But that diary was filled with negative emotions and held back tears. I needed to look back into the past. I went inside and found her old diary from two years back one. I turned up the same day as today… 
 
'As usual the day started with my baby's kiss. I can't understand why he hasn't got tired of doing that even after 2 years of marriage. He's always late to the office because of his ruckless schedule in the morning. He didn't have any breakfast , and said that his stomach was full after eating me. He's so unbelievable. He really needs to take care of his job. He's getting too bad at deadlines after vidhu and nidhi are born. Always playing with them and getting scolded at the office. He took a round 5 days extra leave this month itself. He's not understanding his caliber. But I'm so happy seeing him like this. He's so happy, after two days, it's our anniversary. I know that he must be planning something crazy. I hope it's not too crazy this time. Night he didn't go to that friend's party he had. I always advise him to go and join them. It's part of networking and he always feels it is artificial. He came straight home and started playing with the twins. Later took me on a night drive, he couldn't stop touching my body for some time. I feel so weird since a lot of people stare at us. After draining my whole energy for today, sir is sleeping like a baby in bed. He's really a knucklehead. But my knuckle head'

 
That 'my knucklehead' really made my eyes wet. Heart became somewhat normal. The problem was me trying to become someone I thought my family needed. But instead I became someone society recommended and totally ruined my family's happiness. She can't say anything since it was something she said she wanted. I was turning into a perfect husband society recommends. But she didn't sign up for this one. We both had an adventurous love story and we both were mad in love for 5 years. After marriage also we kept on loving the same way for three years. I still thought we were the same. But we have lost it somewhere. 
 
She quitted her job for the family. She doesn't even have any other friends, I was her friend. I used to hang around with her. Now she's stuck inside a home. When children start to go to school, things will get harder for her. And even my children are not getting enough time with me. What's the use of this money and status? Why don't things doesn't make sense now? 
 
What should I do?
 
My mind was blank. I went back to bed after keeping diaries in their places. I saw her sleeping like a baby… 
There she was
My wife, my best friend, my love, my half
 
She was keeping her tears at bay since she felt everything was normal with me. She felt the problem was only with her. Woman is indeed a art. 
 
I kept my arms around her and pulled her closer. I knew at the moment what she meant by emotional desires. 

 
Next day I took leave. It was Saturday and I said to her that I wanted a break. Usually she'll tease me. But she didn't . I understood that she even wanted it. I spent a day with her and the children. Like the old days. It was easy for me to be myself. 
 
I saw her writing her diary for around half an hour that day. I found that her smile was different. It was not just pleasant. But there was life to it. She came and sat near me… 
 
" Shall we go for a ride? " I asked her
" Now? It's already 11 "
" Will you come? "
" Let's go… "
 
I took her out on my bike. Took her to our favorite restaurant. During nights you'll always get good food in Bangalore . It's hard to find roads vacant even at night. It's been a while since I took her out like that. We both sat on a bench in the bridge. It gave a beautiful view of the city and the stars. 
 
I holded her hands. It was so cold. She kept her head over my shoulder. 
 
"I'm sorry" I said in a calm voice
"For what  … she took her head off and stared at me"
"Don't worry. I'm not going to say that i cheated on you. " We both laughed
"Then what did you do? "
"I saw you crying that day sitting in the dining hall. I checked your diary. "
She was silent… she turned her head straight. Her eyes was not ready to keep contact. 
 
"I understood how much I messed up last year. And it's my fault… "
 
"Shut up… it's not your fault. I just want to live like teenagers always maybe. Don't be hard on yourself. You work day and night for us"
 
"Ey moron… look at me"
 
She turned her eyes to me. I saw the girl whom I fell in love with 10 years back. 
 
"Whatever mess we are in. We both are responsible for it. I'm not as happy as you think I'm. I'm also running the show thinking that you're happy. The moment I got to know that you're sad, my whole heart became heavy. I love you the same way I loved you before. But I've forgotten to express it. I've changed myself into some boring responsible pain in the @$$."
 
"I… I don't know what to say"
 
"Don't say anything. But let's fix this. Let's restart our love life like before. We've always fixed things. We have fought a thousand times. This became worse because we were afraid to fight this time. You're the reason I wake up every day. You're the person whom I care most about in this world. If you're not happy, it doesn't make any sense to me. "
 
"Vijay… " Her eyes have already started to rain. 
 
I stood up and took her by the waist. Kissed her lips. She kept her arms around me. She kept it so tight. Like a child who is not ready to leave. I felt her heartbeat. 
 
It went on for a while. 
 
"Don't ever open my diary again.. " She tried that cute angry face and laughed at me while wiping off the tears. 
 
"I'll try" We both laughed
 
I looked up to the sky.Moon was not alone that day. Stars have accompanied him. Cheering him up to spread light into millions of couples who try to find their forgotten romantic life. </div>
