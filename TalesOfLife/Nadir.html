                        <div class="story-container">Have you ever experienced depression? That feel of losing yourself. "You're joking right. You used to speak that much about everything! Don't make jokes that you had a phase of depression".well the truth is, I had a lot of phases of depression. Every time when the weight of depression grows stronger. I used to think, so this is depression. Not the previous one I had. Because once you come up from a particular type of depression. Next time, it's going to be stronger than that. Because you already learnt how to come out from depression you had before. 
One month back it started. I was having a terrible week. Alot of emotional events. And it was my sem exam day. When I woke up, I was feeling somewhat drained. Some kind of headache. My energy was drained completely. Then the cycle of overthinking started. It was my sem exam week and I had sem exams for next two weeks. I didn't had any backlogs till then. But I felt I can't even write a single exam in that state. I didn't even understand what to do. I didn't had proper sleep for past few days. I knew that I was too stressed. If it was due to stress. It was my own mistake that I didn't concentrate on my career. I really felt... After coming this far... Now I need to face such a situation. I was even ready to give up on exams and take exams on another try. But then my friends came into picture. If it weren't for them, I would have got a absent grade in my exams. I don't even know what's the after scenario. I dumped alot of glucose into mouth and went for exam. But my health was not ready to stay with me. I struggled each day. I met the doctor atleast 5 times in those 20 days of exams. My health almost got restored, but headache didn't. I was searching for the reason for my headache. I completed my exams somehow. I would like to thank all my friends for being there with me those days. It was really pain in the ass for them. I was in a state of anxiety. When I called some doctor on online consultation. That guy was like, go and do MRI Scan, urine test, blood test etc. I did another mistake called searching in google with symptoms. Oh my freaking God, google was like, "you're gonna die bitch". The main issue was my stress. It was the time when I was at the down bottom the 'nadir' in my emotional state. I couldn't understand whether it's my thoughts or any physical issue. I tried all kind off stuff to make my mind clear. So that I can't differentiate whether it's my mind or body. But I was not able to do that. That pain and suffering, I've never experienced in this extent till now. When ever you wake up, the headache will be there to say like
"Morning bitch.. Have a ducking day".
I was arrogant about the stability of my mind. A lot... Each and every day slowly my confidence started to drain. I was not worried about dying. Of course, I started to feel that something is wrong with me. I really rewinded all my past. It was pretty fun. I can't even start to explain what all I over thought in these days. It's true that most important thing in this world is health , both mental and physical. And sometimes even though if you try to take care of both of these. External factors will fuck you. These are the moments when you feel so vulnerable. When you realise that many things which everyone is tormenting about have no value. 
But I had no regrets. Only one maybe. That one decision which I couldn't forgive myself. It's not like I have only done one mistake. But since this decision was already having it's impact on my mental state. My brain made me remember about it. Sometimes it's better to have a switch to delete some things from head. 
So for two months, from nov last week to jan 15, this was my mental state. Met alot of doctors. Going from here and there. The cycle of over thoughts. Checking the reason behind headache. I never had the thing called headache in my life before. Not even once I remember. Suddenly, I was becoming that guy in movie who has headache from morning to evening. I don't even remember the number of pain killers I took. The most irritating part is the responsibilities. When I wanted a heritage resort type environment, what I got was exams, project reviews, torture and judgement from a lot of people. Most of them were like, it's just your mind. Don't worry... 
I really wanted to kick their ass. But I didn't had any options because my mind was having it's bad time. Maybe it's my mind. 
This cycle of frustration repeated day by day.Finally I tested my eye and got specs. It's just been two days... 
I didn't felt any difference in my vision because it was short sight and it was only on one eye. So it took a long time to figure it out. But I still can't believe that this much headache was caused by this stupid stuff? 
It's like preparing for IAS exam and got the question whose that prime minister who is rarely visible in India before pandemic. It was so simple right...
But it was my mind which aggravated the pain. That anger, pain, the urge to kill someone (I'm kidding... I am happy to say that I don't have that much hatred towards world.) 
So... It was physical... My mental state might have triggered the pain. Or did the mental torture I had in those days worsen my eye sight. See... This was the issue. For a moment... (Ey stupid brain.. Now you don't have headache right. Let me complete this blog. Don't irritate) 
 
It was quite a nice experience after all. I tried to add some humour into the conjuring events. But I learnt many things. When you feel like you don't have much days left to live. You really change into different person. It's all about how you lived till that point of life. For me... I was worried about those people who love me. I was worried about the people I hurt. There wasn't a lot.. Which kept my heart at peace. One day I even thought to make all people who love me to hate me. 
 
It's true... At last... The only thing matter is the way you lived. 
 
Life is complex but it's simple... I'm kidding... But life is like that. 
 
There was one person who stayed with me in this journey and helped me a lot even though kept saying it's just my mind. Thank you. 
 
These days are my toughest till now. But I kept fighting. Even though I felt I'm gonna die soon. I believe that next time life might treat me with something much more irritating than this. I have good relationship with my fate u know. 
 
It's ok to be depressed. It's ok to feel low. It's ok to be at your nadir. But it's not ok to give up... And it's no one else responsibility to take care of you. Don't expect that either
 
But... It would have been good if we can just remove all our memories from everyone who love us right, when we die? Well... It's complicated! 
 
Live... Love...explore and Give a shit about fate! 
If you ever felt depressed... As a brother, as a friend , you can talk with me... 
 
"You moron... Depressed people won't search for people.. U need to go to them"... Yeh I know... But I went to few people because no one came for me! It's too hard to even understand what's someone is going through. </div>
