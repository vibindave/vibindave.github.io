                        <div class="story-container">Did you ever wished to say " fuck off " when you're in between a conversation.. or wished to say "no" when someone asks you a favour ?
I know ..I know.. almost everyday...
When I say to people that I like to write something and I like science... Language of people changes.. They add their complex thoughts, prespectives, sarcasm, literature when they talk... I love those... Few atleast.
But I don't want to hear how you judge others... I don't want to know how to judge another person. Example.. when I'm at a party, obviously I'll be quiet somewhat... It doesn't mean that I want others to behave like that... That means I don't want to hear
"See... She's behaving like a whore.."
"This guy has no maturity...see how he is laughing like a buffoon"
"Those two behave themselves as Romeo and Juliet" 
 
You should understand that..
You should be jealous that no one I intrested in you than that "whore"...
You can't find a way to laugh in your fucking miserable life than that "buffoon"
And... Probably...you're just jealous because you're single in terms of Romeo and Juliet...
 
And irony is...
They people who sit quiet or comparatively less vibrant is considered boring by the people who literally enjoy that party...( It's not one way of bullshit)
 
I will be in boring zone or vibrant zone according to the people in that party...
 
Why don't we find our ways to be happy... (don't ask me whether roasting others is not a way to be happy...Roast people who mind other's business...like what I'm doing now...But leave people who mind their own buisness)...
If people are conserned about my actions... I usually say one thing to them..."I don't care what you think about me... I feel sorry that your life is not interesting as mine"
