                    <div class="story-container"><p><strong style="background-color: transparent;">The Mercenary</strong><span style="background-color: transparent;">&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">“Bro, I'm going to be an IAS officer, you wait and watch.” Dheera was shouting inside my ears.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">“Okay dude, I know you're class topper and your brain is not completely clay, so I'm looking forward to it.”</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">Dheera sat there staring at the setting sun. The banyan tree behind us might have witnessed our whole childhood.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">Dheera and I have been friends for more than a decade now. I remember sitting under this banyan tree just like this years ago.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">“Our 12th classes are getting over soon, you planned what to do? I'm getting stressed, everyone is making a big scene of this. And I have no idea what the hell I should do.” I was really stressed over the responsibility which is on my doorsteps.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">“Haha, We'll be fine da, we have cracked high scores in every mock test we've written in almost all entrance exams, and I'm sure we'll get into some good colleges.” Dheera always seems motivated and He's been my academic rival for ages.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">“That's my hope too, I want to script history by getting into some privileged institute in this country. Everyone in our Village should be shocked. We need to prove that we don't need coaching centers to crack these stupid exams.” I love when we get pumped up about the future. I never want to let Dheera think that I'm a hopeless kid trying to level up with him.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">“Haha, we will … Make sure you bring some books for me when you come Tomorrow to play football. I'll return that. Dan Brown books and those Physics journals.”</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">“Haa , okay… How's your part time work going on? I heard there was a fight in the hotel. “ Dheera used to work in a hotel in the evening as part time. Since his father was I'll, he wanted to take some burden off his shoulders. I hate the fact that he inspires me everyday. When I go and do nothing in my house, he was there helping the family. When I asked my dad whether I can do part time, he said there is no need for that. My dad wants me to focus on studies. But still, I feel a bit down in front of my rival.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">“Yeh, you know, right? That hotel owner is also the candidate for the next election. So there is always some hostility around there. Can't help… Last time one guy poured hot water on my hands. The water was not that..”</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">“You moron, you didn't even tell me. That's that black shade on your right arm. You son of a…”&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">“Oi oi, what my mom did… calm down</span><strong style="background-color: transparent;">.” </strong><span style="background-color: transparent;">Dheera was laughing and I was pissed.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">“I'm going, do whatever…” I jumped off the tree pavement and walked away with frustration.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">Dheera was well built, but the only time I saw him fight was when somebody tried to hit me during an inter-district football match. I've never seen him fight even when somebody stepped on his nerves. I always felt I owed him for it . I wanted to hit the guy who poured hot water on Dheera, but I know that even if I start the fight, he'll be the one saving me. I felt so awkward, and hated every part of myself.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">I decided not to sulk over my helplessness and decided to join the gym from Tomorrow.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">…</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">Days passed , our 12 th class came to an end. I had come to Dheera’s hotel for dinner. It was almost the time the hotel was closed. I came late since I didn't want him to serve food for me. It'll make him look so cool.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">“I told you to come early, biriyani is over, only poratta and gravy is there.”</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">“That's fine, you haven't eaten na, we'll eat together. “</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">“Kk, let me wrap some things up here. “</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">We both sat and ate food, I was so hungry after waiting that long. At home mom used to make me eat on time. Now it's almost midnight.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">“You dumbwit, I know you eat at this time everyday, you're going to get an ulcer and die soon. Don't leave me alone . “ I smirked at him sarcastically.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">“ho… don't be so attached, already Sruthi was complaining that you're not spending time with her.”</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">I might have forgotten to introduce my lovely girl friend, Sruthi, an insane pain in the bum. But one soul I can't live without.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">“hahaha “ I laughed it off since I didn't want to pull up a girlfriend topic. Dheera had a heart break 6 months ago, that bitch, also who was my friend, decided to put an end to years long relationship since Dheera was from a low caste. I wanted to murder her and Dheera calmed me down. She was the one who roamed behind him. And now the bitch got to know that she belonged to some high caste.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">I saw Dheera's eyes tear up when I mentioned something about her. I have never pulled up the topic of love ever since. The guy broke his elbow and hasn't cried, and one psycho chick came into his life and made him cry.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">“We have exams starting in one month. Make sure you study and come and join the same college I do. I'll leave you behind and go for sure. “</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">“Haha, you have a reservation bro… I need to have double the marks to join the same college as you.” Don't feel like I made an awkward comment about it. I can say whatever comes to mind with him. Because we have debated about every single topic in this world. And he understands every emotion I have. And we both knew that we get almost the same marks in every exam we attempt. He scores better most of the time.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">“Haha, you study twice as much as me then. I'm gonna break your legs if you don't go to the same college as me. “ Dheera's face looked gloomy when he said this.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">“Ey, did I make you sad or what. You know that sometimes my brain doesn't work. And also I'm jealous of how smart you are. “&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">“ Haha…enough enough, the thing is, Dad’s health issues deteriorated, and I need some money for paying some loan I took. “ I rarely see this guy being low.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">“When did you take a loan?. Who the hell gave you a loan in the first place?. “</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">“ You remember right? My sis got that scholarship to study abroad. Anyhow, she needs to clear one interview. Just for the Visa purpose. The hard part is over, she just needs some sort of clearance from college. For that expense I needed some money. I took it from the hotel owner only. ”</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">“ Be careful with that guy. How much do you need? .”</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">“I need around 13k by the end of the month. I have some 7k, and need rest. “&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">“I have 5k, I don't want to give full money, rest you figure it out. And you need to give me back along with interest. “</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">“Haha… kk fine.”</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">I sent him the money through my account.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">“We had time till month end, why did you send it now itself?.”</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">“I can charge extra interest right? Maths bro maths!” I smirked at him.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">We walked back to the junction. I was going away to my aunt’s house. I'll be giving my entrance exams from there. As much as I would miss Dheera, There are no single exam centers here. I need to travel 50 km. Of Course I'm worried about Dheera, I even asked him to come and stay with me. But the guy said he can't take leaves. He'll be travelling to the city for every exams. But since the moron is a genius, he'll be fine.</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">“Be careful on your way home. And don't stare at dogs and race them like last time. “ Dheera was loved by dogs, but in my case , it completely depends on the dog's mood.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">“Kk kk… Go and get some sleep. It's 1 AM. I always wondered how he used to come to school everyday with that much energy every day.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">“You don't forget to put some money in your bank account. I know you sent me everything you had. Banks love to grab money from the poor in the name of minimum balance violation. “</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">I walked back without any reply. He was right, 5k was all I had with me. All my savings…&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">…</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">A month passed…</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">I was at my aunt's house, getting royal treatment since I was studying all the time. I kept my smart phone away since I wanted to completely focus on studies. I will meet Dheera next week, there is an exam scheduled.</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">“Dave, you heard what happened in the village ?” Mom had come to see me.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">“Nope, mom's face looked pale. She was tense.”</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">“Dheera stabbed a person, he was in icu, he escaped death, but Dheera is in remand. They have charged FIR. “</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">I felt like my head and feet were going numb. My brain froze for a minute. I regained my composure slowly and asked</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">“What happened? Did anyone try to hurt him? Why did he do that?.”</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">Police are saying it's due to election conflicts, the election got over right? They were saying it was some revenge.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">“Nonsense, he was not even part of any campaign. He doesn't like all these. I need to go and meet him now.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">“You can't meet him now Dave, he's in custody as I said. We'll let you know when you can meet him. You need to focus on exams, I know this is hard , but you need to focus.”</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">Focus? I focus ? After all this? That's my friend right there. My head was going into chaos.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">I sat there, I was facing difficulties breathing. He's not a murderer, he's kind… Why did he do that to me? Why?&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">My life turned to hell after that. I got to know that he confessed the crime and said it was revenge for killing some guy in the past. But I knew that he didn't even know about this guy in the discussion.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">I wanted to kick him, grab his neck and ask him why he did that … I tried contacting his sister. She said she doesn't know anything. She said Dheera is not speaking with anybody. I came to the conclusion that he did it for the money. But did the person who I look upto turn into a goon who kills for money? My heart was going on tantrums every day.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">Dheera was given 4 years of imprisonment. Since the victim didn't die the punishment was reduced.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">I flipped due to the chaos and ruined many of my exams. Somehow I came back to my senses, I never went back to Village and my parents also thought that'd be the best idea. I never could speak with him. I joined an engineering college far away. Trying to run away from all the sadness.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">I wanted to go to the jail and meet him. Scold him for my situation. Blame him for everything that happened. But I couldn't muster the courage to do it.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">…</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">Five years passed,&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">I came to my village, I got a job in Hyderabad, I worked there as a system engineer.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">Village still looked the same, I had never visited my home town in the last 5 years. Somehow I hated this place.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">“Mom, is Dheera in the village? “</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">Mom's face was filled with a kind of disgust.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">“He has become one of the goons here. He's running our MLA’s hotel along with some guys. He's not our Dheera anymore. By some god's grace, his family is fine. A lot of people came forward to help them, his sister went to Germany. She's looking after the family now. I heard his mom and dad are not speaking with him.”</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">I was so busy in my world that I had almost recovered from the disaster named Dheera. I rarely remembered him. Somehow I didn't care anymore. It's true, people forget…</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">“You don't go and meet him. He's not your guy anymore. “ Mom reminded</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">But I had to meet him…</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">I went to the hotel, and I saw him sitting at the counter.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">I went there, I pulled him out of the counter grabbing his shirt. Punched my right first into his cheeks. I didn't even have enough time to think about what I was doing. He fell down, I saw some people running towards us. Dheera stood up fast and showed them signs to stop. He rubbed his cheeks and laughed.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">“Hi bro, long time no see. “&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">I wanted to punch him again…</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">“That's one way to say hi, how are you dude? “</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">I punched him again, I had gone nuts. There was pin drop silence in the hotel, everybody looked at us.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">“Aren't you gonna tell your friends to beat me up?” I asked him…</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">“He still had that smile on his face, but he stared down.”</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">I didn't understand why I did that. I had forgotten about him… or did I?</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">I walked away…&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">“Bro… let's talk?” I heard his voice from back.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">I stood there, he joined me. We walked to our usual spot. The banyan tree, the mammoth witnessed the reunion of two separated souls.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">“Your anger settled or you want to beat me again? “</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">“Why?”</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">“What why? I needed money…”</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">“You couldn't ask me? “</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">“Yeh, you're Birla’s beta to ask you. The last time we saw each other you have a null account.”</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">“I would have arranged, you fool…”</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">“Yeh … you need to ask your dad for 10 rupees and you could have arranged 10 lakhs.”</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">“10 lakhs? For what? .”</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">“Well, my sister's education scholarship had a clause that she needed to show 5 lakhs of bank balance. And my dad was going to die in a few months because his liver was gone. And transplantation costed around 7 lakhs.”</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">“Don't play dumb with me… all these things happened later. After you went to jail. “</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">“Oh… you heard the story about some good people helping my family right? They hired me you fool…”</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">“So you decided to kill someone just because you needed money? “</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">“Okay tell me, what should've I done? Suffer and let my dad die and sister suicide ?”</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">“ You're delusional… “.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">“We can be bought Dave…”</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">“What?”</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">“People like me can be bought. Because we don't have much hope or privilege to begin with. If one cyclone hits us, our desperation can be feasted by powerful people. “</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">“So you decided to stab and kill a guy because you can solve your problems?”</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">“He was not an innocent little man, he killed one guy earlier and he was out on parole.”</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">“That's your justification?”</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">“You don't understand Dave, things are easy for you… “</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">“Now what should I do? Sulk up the thing you did and just forget what happened? You're a psychopath you fool. “</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">“You could have come and visited me? “</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">Dheera was looking away all this time. His eyes were happy.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">“I didn't come here to reignite our friendship, so bye… and if you're planning to be a mercenary and blabber about people buying you. Go to hell … stay away from me. You're just a pathetic villain who is trying to justify your actions.”</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">I jumped off the pavement and walked towards the place where I parked my bike.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">“Eyy, I stabbed him in the ass… “</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">“What?...”</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">“Oh we used to read Grey's anatomy right? You remember Gluteus maximus?I mean your big ass.&nbsp;I stabbed him there, also in the lateral abdomen and trapezius muscle…Two stabs were precise, one was okay okay. Keep this secret will ya, ” I heard him laughing from behind.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">Some things in the past rushed into my head. We both used to read Grey's anatomy. Dheera used to know each and every artery around the body. His memory was insane. Those were the places with the least fatality rate.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">“I know you can't forgive me for what I did? I can't… but people like me, they can be bought… so if you want to help such cases in future . Make sure you are in a position to buy them. “</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">I walked away… I remembered the guy who used to dream a lot. I remembered the guy who remembered every single equation he ever learnt. Did he become a hitman? A deadly Mercenary? Or did he save somebody's life?&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">I didn't turn back, I moved away from him. He stood there under the banyan tree.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">“Sorry, that I couldn't buy you….” I whispered to myself.</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">…</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">Money might not buy happiness, but money has the ability to buy people's lives.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">And it's going to be like that forever</span></p><p><br></p></div>
