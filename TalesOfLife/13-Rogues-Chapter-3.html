                        <div class="story-container">It was a horrible day, as usual my brain couldn't understand what the hell was going on. I had come to my favorite bar as usual to knock out my senses. 
 
Whole country was going crazy, Whole cyber department was in pursuit to remove the video from the internet, but it seemed like a lost cause since it had multiple sources. That whole video was just a bluff, but it had led to chaos in the country. 
 
I saw people chanting prayers for the new God. Most of the people who have some senses kept silent since the "God" did a great job according to them. In this decade we have learnt to adore villains who work for a good cause. Some stupid people from each religion was trying to adopt the new God. All the revolutionaries came back to alive. 
 
On other hand I was fighting my common sense because somehow I felt like I'm happy for the new God. 
 
"Give me something strong enough to make me numb," I told the bartender. 
"See, you're not a cop anymore and I'm not interested to baby care you after you pass out here! " He always repeats the same dialogue. But somehow I always woke up in my bed every morning. 
"Don't worry, I'll try to reach home before passing out! "
 
"Hi Dave! " Someone tapped on my shoulder. I turned back. 
It was Dheeraj
"You came! I thought you would be busy! "I felt like I needed more info about the new God. I couldn't understand why I was so interested. 
"Well, this location motivated me more than your company. " His dad jokes never get old. 
We both laughed
"You know why I asked you to meet. I wanted to know what happened with the interrogation. "
"It's nuts, they're repeating whatever they said in the video. Keep referring to a God. We even have doubts whether these people are just nuts. But the technology they used to automate the telecast of that video is so advanced. Within seconds it was hosted on multiple servers. And everything was cloud driven. "
"So they had help from others? "
"One of the people in that group explained how he managed to do all that geeky stuff. "
"Any lead towards their God, and who are these three peoples."
"That's the most weird part, we don't have any data regarding these three people. No ID, fingerprints, nothing! And God remains an illusion"
"You're kidding! So you are saying they don't have any background data regarding the culprits? "
"Yup! Nothing yet. And Identity of four of the 13 people who died is still not figured out. We have sent their fingerprints for checking. Maybe by tomorrow morning we'll get the info. Rest 9 members are convicted culprits in different cases from different places. All of them were involved in someone's death"
" You guys will be going crazy until you find any intel regarding these three then"
"Can't help it! "
"Why do you think they surrendered, why did their God leave them behind? "
"They just said that their job is done and they just wanted to let the world know that they don't regret anything. "
"That's bullshit, I feel like they surrendered to make sure no one else gets caught. Something seems so strange! "
" I know that Dave, don't play Sherlock Holmes now, I had enough today! "
"Sorry dude, "
"Why don't you just come back to force, I heard IG sir haven't accepted your resignation letter yet. You're on long leave according to the books till now. If you're missing your job, why don't you come back. "
 
"I don't plan to put on that uniform again. But I am so intrigued by this God, maybe because I like him. "
"Yeh, go and take membership, didn't you saw those pics yesterday! "
"I know, but it's like I'm in a battle with myself. "
"Whatever… Now let me get drunk! "
 
We both were frustrated and a while later we both were drunk and happy!. 
 
"You see that girl at that table, if you can get her number, I'll pay your bill. Or else you should" Dheeraj was in a chill mood. 
"Challenge accepted! " I know I'm gonna regret this. But anyhow I had plans on getting laid tonight. 
 
I went near that table, 
"Hi, I'm Dave .You're so hot, and I feel so cold. Can you keep me warm for a while? " Oh great! That was so lame. 
"Go away! " She seemed so angry. I was not in the mood for getting a slap. 
"Ohkk sorry, I'll leave! "
I came back to Dheeraj
"Haha" He was laughing hard, "well the bill is on you comrade, I'm leaving! "
He was so happy, People do love when others gets their ass kicked! 
 
I sat there waiting for my next glass of whiskey. 
 
"Hi" Someone called me from behind
It was a girl, she looked beautiful
"Hello! " My senses were already dull because of alcohol and I couldn't take my eyes off of her. Somehow I managed to put aside my emotions. 
 
"Hi, do I know you? " I wished she was not someone I picked up from the bar and dumped before. 
"I was listening to your conversation, thought to come and check whether you need someone to keep you warm "
"For that you need to be hot right. " I laughed and regretted for saying that the same moment
"I'm kidding" I knew I'll regret if I mess this up
"Chill, I just want someone to cool me down too. Guilt free sex will do the magic"
"You're in my dreams right? "
"I don't think so, I am Fila, nice to meet you, let's go and have some fun! "
"Wait buddy, so you're saying that I don't need to say lies or act like a stupid gentleman to get laid? "
"Don't be a kid, I find you attractive and I have seen you before picking out different woman from here, I'm just making your job easy"
I was so horny that I felt she's some angel came to rescue me. 
 
We didn't talk much, we went straight to my apartment. Somehow the whole God stuff didn't bother me a bit now. 
 
The moment we closed the door of the apartment, my hands were on her. I have no idea whether it's the alcohol or her body, it felt really good. I saw her naked body while kissing her on the sofa near the fireplace, it had a beautiful tattoo on her chest, I didn't understand what it was. It seemed like an eagle with wings on fire. My arms and eyes were enjoying her beautiful body. 
"I don't know who you are, but you have great curves. "
"Well, it's yours for now, make good use of it. "
She was something else, The next few minutes, I regretted for being drunk since I might forget even her face tomorrow morning
 
She layed in my arms, covered in sweat. My eyes couldn't stop staring at each drop of sweat in her body. 
 
… 
 
I was trying to wake up . But my head was trying to split into two. 
 
I was sleeping on the sofa naked.thank god, I was under a blanket. And I hope it was not kept on me by Riya. Suddenly I remembered about Fila, I pulled my pants and went to the living room. 
 
"So finally you're up! " Riya was going back to her house after the chores. 
It was already 11:30 . 
 
 
Did you see any woman? 
 
"Fila right? She went in the morning itself, asking you to take care of yourself and not worry about the new God. "
 
"Ohkk"
Oh great… what the hell I shared with her. I don't remember a shit now. I hope she isn't related to the media. Or else Dheeraj will be in great trouble. 
 
I am never going to get drunk like this again. 
… 
I Hope I see Fila again.
