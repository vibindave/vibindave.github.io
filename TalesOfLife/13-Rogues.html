                        <div class="story-container">I had come to the crime scene. I was kindoff excited to know that those people whom I wished to murder was killed. My there were 10 other people who were murdered. Things didn't make any sense. 
 
The farmhouse was swarming with people from the media and police. The area was sealed by police. 
 
"Hello sir, I'm Dave, I used to be a cop. Can you please let me in. " I Approached one person who was guarding the entry inside the crime scene. 
 
"Sorry sir, I can't let you inside without an ID. "
 
"Is Raghu inside? "
 
"DYsp sir? " He was kind of shocked. I looked like a drunk and I was calling out for the legend in the department. 
 
" Dheeraj! Let him inside " Someone called out from the camp nearby. I couldn't see the face in the darkness. 
 
I walked to the camp nearby, Alby was standing in front of the camp. He was my colleague in past. 
 
" Someone seems happy " Alby was smirking at me. 
 
" Of course, by the way. What's the scenario? Who are those 13 people? And those 3 members who confessed the crime? "
 
" You seem to forget that you quit! Still since you are my friend, I'll brief you in… "He took a huge pause. I don't like pauses, it resembles the silence before any chaos. 
 
He continued " We identified 10 of the culprits, all of them are people who committed at least one crime. Some trials have been going on for a few people. Some were out on parole. And we haven't been able to identify three people. "
 
"What kind of crimes, is there any pattern? " 
 
"Neither patterns nor relations, only similarity is that these people have committed some crimes. "
 
"Raghu mentioned that these people were tortured, can I know more about that? Can I go into the crime scene? "
 
" It's a blood shed Dave, the forensic department has asked not to enter the farmhouse for now. I'll show you some footages, come inside"
 
It has been a while stepping inside a crime scene camp. As usual people were shouting random stuff like they knew a lot of details regarding the case. But the truth is, they seemed clueless. Everyone seemed a little bit relaxed since they got their culprits in this case. 
 
Alby pointed towards a computer nearby
"It contains all the footage we took when we came here"
 
I sat in front of the computer, it was a three storey farmhouse. A big ground floor and two stairs leading towards the first floor and second floor. Those were storage compartments. But there wasn't a single object inside that farmhouse which normally exists inside a farmhouse. 
 
A Lot of equipment was stacked on one side of the farmhouse. Ropes, syringes, knives and more. 
 
I was scrolling through the images. The next pic was disturbing, all were pictures of blood patches inside the farmhouse. It's been a while since I saw blood, so I skipped those pictures fastly. 
 
"What the f*ck! " 
Those were the pictures of people who were murdered, some didn't had faces, some didn't had hands. I closed that window. It really made all the alcohol in my blood evaporate. 
 
"Didn't expect this much right? " Alby was standing behind me. 
 
"These people are sick! "
 
"There was one woman who was alleged for throwing her baby from 10th floor since she was mentally retarded. As far as I can tell, she was killed by repeatedly throwing her from the second floor to the bottom. I couldn't stay inside that scene for more than 30 mins. I have seen crime scenes. But not like this one! "
 
 
"No one nearby saw anything suspicious, not even a sound due to this? "
 
"You saw while coming here right, this place is remote, there aren't any residents nearby… 
 
This has become national news by now, you already know those three people in your case right. It's been just 5 hours, but I can assure you that by tomorrow, the whole nation will be talking about this one. Our only relaxation is just that we have those three people who confessed the crimes. Somehow I feel that this isn't over"
 
I was also getting a bad feeling about this. 
 
"Did they say anything regarding this? What exactly was their motive? "
 
"That's the weird part, They informed the police regarding this and surrendered. But they haven't talked about it. They are in our custody. But until now, no more information about it. Raghu sir and Deepak sir are in charge of the investigation, I think they are currently trying to get some information out of them. Three of them are held in district headquarters. "
 
Nothing made any sense to me. Those pictures of victims made my head swing like a pendulum. I came out of the camp and walked near to my car. A lot of noises were overlapping into my ears, but somehow I was not able to process any of them. 
 
I went straight to the bar, I wanted to knock all the senses out of my head. I didn't want to remember any of these tomorrow. 
 
… 
 
I was at the bar, I overheard a conversation about the case. I was drunk completely and it took me a lot of energy to listen to them. 
 
"Did you see that crime news just came… 13 people were murdered, and they are saying that all of them are culprits in different crimes. "
 
"Yeh, those three guys did a great job according to me. Anyhow, these people escaped from law and order in our nation."
 
"Still, it seems so brutal! Taking the law into their own hands like this. "
 
Only if they saw those pictures! Maybe they all deserved this. I was so confused , I ordered a few more shots to get my head go blank. "
 
… 
 
I have no idea what happend after that. I was trying to wake up from a hectic headache. 
 
I saw Riya sweeping my room. 
 
"Finally you're up! It's already noon. I've made some lunch, go and eat. " Even though Riya was my maid, she always took care of me like I'm her little brother… 
 
"You might wanna check out TV, "
 
"Why? "
 
"A video was released by those culprits of that farmhouse case. It really has made everyone crazy here."
 
"What?" All the events from yesterday shoved its way inside my head within a second. 
 
I jumped into my mobile and turned on my mobile. There was that video, people have kept whatsApp status, it was everywhere. They might have pre recorded it and set it to release today. 
 When I opened that video. For the first time I saw their faces. Three of them were standing near a brown wall. I think it's recorded from the farm house. The guy in the middle started talking. 
 
 
"We are here to announce that God has been reborn on earth in order to fight evil again. We are just his soldiers. He'll make sure that the evil souls who feed upon others will be punished. This is just a beginning, Our God doesn't have religion or Boundaries. He only distinguishes between good and evil. 
You don't need to do anything to please our God. He's so dissatisfied with humans. Live without causing harm to others. There won't be any mercy if not! " Video ended. 
 
"What the f*ck!!! "
