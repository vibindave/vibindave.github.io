                        <div class="story-container">"Sis, did you see breaking news?"
"No, what's so special? Same political and celebrity drama right?"
Neha and Rekha was having their tea time talk. Usually they are so fond of virtual world. But online classes and life arised due to corona has led them to have some chitchat in thier leisure time.

"No..Mumbai High court stated that groping is not sexual assault unless there is skin to skin contact" Rekha was surfing through her feed while tasting the tea she had in her hand.

"Means?" Neha never had intrest towards what's happening in society since she never believed in it.

"High court said that the touching the chest part of a woman without removing her dress or without having skin contact should be not considered as sexual assault"

"Hahaha" Neha started laughing.

"So it's not an offense now ?" She asked amidst laughing

"It is an offense.. but it will be considered under outrage of modesty itseems. Which offers less punishments and alot of loopholes"

Neha was still laughing

"What's going on there? You guys are having fun itseems!" Suddenly their mom came in.

They became silent since they were shy to discuss that with their mom.

"Rekha.. Pick those cloths from outside"

"Let me complete my tea…"

"Ok.. but don't forget" She went inside again.

By then Rekha had completed her tea. She went outside for fetching the cloths.

Neha was still thinking about the Mumbai Case.
'If this goes on … People will start to argue that rape with a condom is less offensive since there is no skin to skin contact' She had fell into a pile of thoughts.

"Akka… Please help me here… I'm struggling with these cloths" Rekha was shouting from outside.

"Coming"… Neha took the tea cups into kitchen and went to help Rekha.

Hours passed. Everything went as usual in their life.

Both were ready to sleep after having their dinner. Neha and Rekha used to sleep in same Room.

"Started chatting with your fiance. I guess. You should focus on final exam. Marriage is next year and exam is in two months. Don't forget I'm learning everything from you"

Neha didn't respond anything. She gave reply using a portrait smile.

"Akka(sis)… You are disturbed for a while now! What happened? "

"Nothing dear pumpkin.. She pulled Rekha near her"

Rekha loves to be cuddled by Neha. She tried to cuddle her back to increase the warmth of love.

Neha kept her phone aside.

"Do you remember our picnic three years back?"

"Ofcourse I do.. your fever ruined the trip but! .planned for 2 weeks but we came back in 5 days"

Neha smiled at her.
"Do you remember playing at the beach?"

"Yeh….I enjoyed alot. Especially in pulling you inside water.."

"When we were playing in the water, some people were playing alongside with us right. I was trying to hold breath inside water for a while, suddenly one girl grabbed my chest from behind. Suddenly I jumped out of water… I turned behind and I saw a guy showing his teeth to me. I was in a tremor. I came back from the water."

Rekha was feeling afraid. A kind of fear and agony was arising in her.

"You didn't said this to me till now! Did you tell mom and dad?"

"No… I didn't"

"But.. why?"

"Fear maybe… I was struck by something. Even he had a family with him… I don't know… I couldn't react"

"Why you said this now?"

"You said right.. you will follow my path… But… I don't want you to … In many cases. If it happened now…I would have slapped him there itself. But that touch didn't faded for a long period.. I had nightmares for many days. When someone treat you like that. It will strike us hard in our heart."

Neha's eyes were slowly turning into a pool. Rekha never saw her bold sister crying. And she never wished to see either.

"Don't worry akka… If someone tries to misbehave with me. I would kick their teeth out." Rekha tried to pull Neha out of trauma

Neha laughed and pulled her closer. And kissed in her forehead.

Rekha was slightly afraid. But She felt secure inside her Arms. She knew that if she didn't react, the vultures in the world will tear her apart.

This is just another tale of love,pain and fear. A common tale in a girl's life consisting of a victim and a vulture.</div>
