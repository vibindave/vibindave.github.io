                        <div class="story-container">I haven't wrote a love letter ever for my girl.. but I used to write for some one else's crush... So..let me write one today ≡ƒÿÇ...
 
Hii ... 
I couldn't find a perfect word to start this letter. "Dear sweetheart" won't suit because I hate sweetness and my favorite dish is chicken. "Dear chickenheart" doesn't seems poetic either. I guess you are smiling now and if you're not, you got to know that I am bad at jokes. And if you're smiling, I'm the most unlucky person that I can't see the most beautiful event in this whole universe. But keep smiling, trust me... It motivates my heart to take few more beats on every run.
 
I don't know how much you love me. But I know that you deserve more love. Everytime I see you, my time runs so fast as if you're a blackhole. Ok... ok... No science... But you break all the laws I learnt so far. My soul is having tremendous reactions for your small actions. See, I can't live without talking shit ...but no words come out of my bloody mouth when I see you. 
 
I remember the day I met you. Your hair played tunes for my heart as if they were the strings of a violin. I couldn't forbid my eyes from staring at yours. I always dreamt about traveling through mountains and to witness the beauty from the heights. After seeing your curves, I know my dreams are quite easy when you're with me. Ok...I'll stop this topic here... Or else I'll make this into something else.
 
I won't start saying about your character because this letter will end up as a novel. But I know one thing for sure... We both know beauty won't exist forever. But I won't ever get tired of loving you even if you are in your 70's. I dream about the moment when we sit in the veranda outside our home, without any teeths, staring at the setting sun. I won't forget to hold your hands then...
 
Oh god....I'm getting emotional... let's conclude...
 
"You are the damn perfect bitch for me... Stay like that forever"
