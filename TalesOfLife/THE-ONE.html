                        <div class="story-container">I remember the day
remember the mist
The mist of rhythm
Playing on my heart
 
I stepped into the crowd
My eyes were searching
To hold on to something
Couldn't find anything exhilarating
 
Millions of colours
Billions of emotions
lost count on objects
Still heart kept pounding
 
Suddenly it gave a frenzy
Eyes were frozen
Brain had no idea
Soul had awoken
 
I stood there for a while
Then I woke my brain
Ofcourse it was you
An angel in disguise
 
I couldn't keep my eyes away
They kept on creeping on you
Maybe I didn't wanted to stop
Or did I forget to stop
 
Your eyes painted the stars
Hair played the symphony
In that black dress
You wore me out 
 
It took a while
To stabilize the nerves
I walked towards you
Somehow time had frozen
Or was it my circadian 
 
I waited and waited
For become prey 
In those crystal glare
Atlast you caught me off guard
 
I felt the trembling
You were saying something
My ears couldn't hear anything
Senses were falling
 
I was in a dreamland
Where I could hold your hand
Hold you closer
And dance in that void
 
My eyes were half blind
It only saw you
My ears were deaf
It only heard my heartbeat
 
At that moment 
I knew I had fallen
And my soul knew
She's the one
